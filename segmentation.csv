1-guideline.txt	34. The EBA considers these arguments to be valid and has therefore agreed to postpone the first     reporting period. Given the changes expected from market participants (and in particular from     those that are not yet collecting payment data under the ECB Regulation on payment statistics),     the detailed data breakdowns and the implementation work required, the EBA has decided to	    change the GL so that they now require the data collection to start in January 2019, with the     exception of the data breakdown on exemptions used when SCA was not applied, for which data     collection will start only from the date of application of the RTS on SCA and CSC on 14 September     2019. The EBA clarifies that fraudulent transactions should be assigned to a specific exemption and     thus reported under one exemption only, even though in theory more than one exemption could     have been applicable. This means that the sum of the data reported under non-SCA exemption     fields should equal the total provided separately under non-SCA field.	1
1-guideline.txt	35. This means that the first reporting period will be H1 2019 for CAs to report data on to the ECB and     the EBA by the end of 2019. This will ensure that consistent and comparable data are collected     ahead of the date of application of the RTS on SCA and CSC for CAs and will enable the EBA to     compare the evolution of fraud across payment services and instruments. This has led to a change     in the date of application in paragraph 14 of the GL under the heading ‘Date of application’ (page	16 of this document).	1

Executive Summary Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on payment services in the internal market (Payment Services Directive 2 – PSD2) entered into force in the European Union (EU) on 12 January 2016 and applies since 13 January 2018. One of the PSD2 requirements applicable to all payment service providers (PSPs) relates to the reporting of fraud data on means of payment. More specifically, Article 96(6) PSD2 states that PSPs must provide ‘statistical data on fraud relating to different means of payment to their competent authorities’ and that the competent authorities (CAs) must, in turn, ‘provide EBA and the ECB with such data in an aggregated form’.	0

The EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, has assessed the responses and identified approximately 200 different issues or requests for clarification that respondents had raised.	The EBA agreed with some of these proposals, and their underlying rationale, and has made a number of changes to the GL and related annexes as a result. This includes the requirements in relation to the reporting frequency, which the EBA has changed from a set of data on a quarterly frequency and a more detailed set of data on a yearly frequency to one set of data on a semi-annual frequency. The geographical area, too, has been reduced to the same area for all of the requirements in the GL (with no country-by-country data requirement), and the number of categories of fraudulent transactions to be reported has been reduced from three to two, with fraudulent transactions where the payer is the fraudster now no longer within the scope of the GL. Finally, the fraud types have been aligned across the payment services and instruments. The other requirements proposed in the CP remain unchanged, including the exclusion of account information service providers from the fraud statistics reporting obligations.	0

More specifically, Article 96(6) PSD2 provides that ‘Member States shall ensure that payment    service providers provide, at least on an annual basis, statistical data on fraud relating to different    means of payment to their competent authorities (CAs).

Those CAs shall provide EBA and the ECB    with such data in an aggregated form’.	3. Not all Member States (MS) currently collect fraud data for all payment instruments, and those    that do tend to use different definitions of what a fraudulent payment transaction is, different    methodologies and/or different data breakdowns. In particular, MS that currently do collect fraud    data either do not cover transactions using all payment instruments or transactions made through    all types of payment service providers (PSPs) within their jurisdiction, or the data categories and/or    level of detail differs.	0

The European System of Central Banks (ESCB), in its function as overseer of payment schemes and    instruments, collects fraud data too, but those data are limited to card payments and based on    non-legally binding reporting requirements. Additional payment statistics are collected by the ECB,    with the assistance of the euro area national central banks, from euro area PSPs and these include    data on all means of payments but do not, at the moment, include reporting of data related to    fraudulent payment transactions. 1	0

Against this background, the EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, has developed two sets of    Guidelines (GL) on fraud data reporting requirements. The two GL aim to ensure that the highlevel provisions in Article 96(6) PSD2 are implemented consistently across the MS of the European    Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) and that the aggregated data provided to the    EBA and the ECB are comparable and reliable.	0

The EBA considered these arguments and arrived at the view that the GL are a tool for supervisors     to monitor compliance with PSD2 itself and the technical standards and GL that the EBA has     developed in support of the directive, including the RTS on SCA and CSC. Most of the respondents     who raised this issue specifically queried whether or not there was a link between the GL and the     calculation of the fraud rate for the purpose of the transaction-risk analysis (TRA) exemption under     Article 18 of the RTS on SCA and CSC. The EBA clarifies that the GL and the RTS on SCA and CSC are     aligned to the extent that the same two categories included in the reporting for the purpose of the     EBA GL, namely unauthorised transactions and transactions as a result of the manipulation of the     payer, should be used to calculate the fraud rate as explained in paragraph 46 of the EBA Opinion     published on 13 June 2018.	0

In addition, a number of respondents queried the link between the EBA GL and the ECB Regulation     on payment statistics (ECB/2013/43). On the basis of Article 96(6) PSD2, which refers to both the     ECB and the EBA, the objectives of the draft GL included an objective for the ESCB oversight of     payment schemes and instruments. In parallel, the ECB is currently reviewing its Regulation and     has for that purpose conducted a fact-finding exercise. This review is exploring, inter alia, whether     the scope of the Regulation can be extended to include fraud statistics to serve the ESCB’s     oversight function. In view of this development, the EBA has concluded that the EBA GL should be     primarily a tool for the purpose of supervision and that therefore the data required to be reported     should be suitable and necessary for those purposes. As a result, the EBA GL no longer require the     reporting of data that are solely relevant for oversight purposes.	0

The EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, has endeavoured to ensure that the methodology,     definitions, fraud types and categories that are specified in the EBA GL when requiring reporting     of the same payment data are consistent with other reporting instruments (e.g. the ECB Regulation     on payment statistics), thus minimising the reporting burden on PSPs.	0

Some respondents disagreed with the inclusion of ‘manipulation of the payer’ and ‘payer acting     fraudulently’ in addition to ‘unauthorised transactions’ within the total of ‘fraudulent payment     transactions’, arguing that these data were unreliable or that such fraud was not within the control     of PSPs and therefore should not be reported by them. The EBA considered these arguments and     arrived at the view that, while it is important to have a complete and accurate picture of payment     fraud, fraud that is completely outside of the control of PSPs should not be included, as it is of     limited relevance and interest to the supervisors of PSPs (although it may be relevant for other     authorities, including law enforcement). The EBA has therefore concluded that the category ‘payer     acting fraudulently’ should be excluded.	0

By contrast, and although the reporting of data under the category of ‘fraud by manipulation of     the payer’ may not be completely reliable yet, the EBA is of the view that such fraud cases are     caused by a third party manipulating a payer into making a payment and that it is, at least partially,     the responsibility of the PSP to identify any such potential case. This is particularly the case with     regard to the use of transaction monitoring systems, and in particular TRA. This is of particular     concern to the EBA, given that this type of fraud has significantly increased in recent years,     suggesting that fraudsters may be shifting to this modus operandi. Therefore PSPs and CAs will     need to report data to this category alongside data in the category of unauthorised transactions.	0

Regarding the reporting of fraudulent payment transactions in the context of direct debits, the     EBA clarifies that refunds under eight weeks should not be automatically reported, as they do not     always indicate fraud cases; such transactions should be reported only if they were subject to fraud     and the reporting PSP was aware that this was the case, without implying any legal obligation to     ask the payment service user whether this was the case.	0

A significant number of respondents disagreed with the proposal in the CP not to include registered     AISPs. Some respondents suggested that these providers should also be monitoring fraud and that,     as new providers, it was important for them to report. However, most respondents agreed that     these providers could not report any fraudulent payment transactions data and that including     them would therefore require a change in the scope of the GL, which is limited to fraudulent     payment transactions.	0

Having assessed these responses, the EBA remains of the view that, for the purpose of these GL,     registered AISPs remain excluded from the requirement to report on ‘means of payment’ in     accordance with Article 96(6) PSD2. For overall supervisory purposes, statistical data from     registered AISPs may be relevant to CAs, independently from this reporting.	0

When developing the CP, the EBA had not specifically considered card-based payment instrument     issuers (CBPIIs). Having assessed the responses received and having considered the business     models of CBPIIs, the EBA has concluded that CBPIIs, too, should report under the card issuer Data     Breakdowns C and E in Annex 2 of the GL.	0

A number of respondents also queried if sub-acquirers or acquirers should report. Again, the EBA     has assessed the responses received and has concluded that the acquirer that has the contract     with the payment service user is the one required to report the transaction and that transactions     should be reported under Data Breakdown D on card acquiring.	0

With regard to the scope of the GL, the draft CP included both gross and net fraud. Many     respondents were critical of the inclusion of net fraud. They criticised the definition used as well     as questioning the practical implementation and raising methodological issues related to     calculating net fraud figures. Many of these respondents also disagreed that the inclusion of net     fraud would provide CAs, the EBA and the ECB with the information they sought, namely where     the responsibility lay and consequently who had borne the losses. They also suggested it was more     a prudential measure than a data reporting one, and therefore not relevant to these GL.	0
