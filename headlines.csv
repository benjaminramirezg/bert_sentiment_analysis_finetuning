1.1.   For the purposes of reporting statistical data on fraud in accordance with these Guidelines,        the payment service provider should report for each reporting period:	0
1.2.   For the purposes of Guideline 1.1, the payment service provider (including the payment        instrument issuer where applicable) should report only payment transactions that have been        initiated and executed (including acquired where applicable). The payment service provider        should not report data on payment transactions that, however linked to any of the        circumstances referred to in Guideline 1.1, have not been executed and have not resulted in        a transfer of funds in accordance with PSD2 provisions.	0
1.3.   In the case of money remittance services where funds were transferred from a payer’s        payment service provider to a payer’s money remitter payment service provider (as part of        a money remittance payment transaction), it is the payer’s payment service provider, rather        than the money remitter payment service provider, who should report the payment        transactions from the payer’s payment service provider to the money remitter. Such        transactions should not be reported by the payment service provider of the beneficiary of        the money remittance payment transaction.	0
1.4.   Transactions and fraudulent transactions where funds have been transferred by a money        remitter payment service provider from its accounts to a beneficiary account, including        through arrangements offsetting the value of multiple transactions (netting arrangements),        should be reported by the money remitter payment service provider in accordance with Data        Breakdown G in Annex 2.	0
1.5.   Transactions and fraudulent transactions where e-money has been transferred by an emoney provider to a beneficiary account, including where the payer's payment service        provider is identical to the payee's payment service provider, should be reported by the emoney provider in accordance with Data Breakdown F in Annex 2. Where the payment        service providers are different, payment is only reported by the payer’s payment service        provider to avoid double counting.	0
1.6.   Payment service providers should report all payment transactions and fraudulent payment        transactions in accordance with the following:	0
2.1.   The payment service provider should report statistical information on:	0
2.2.   The payment service provider should report the statistical information specified in Guideline	0
2.1 in terms of both volume (i.e. number of transactions or fraudulent transactions) and value        (i.e. amount of transactions or fraudulent transactions). They should report volumes and        values in actual units, with two decimals for values.	0
2.3.   A payment service provider authorised, or a branch established, in a Member State of the        euro area should report the values in euro currency, whereas a payment service provider        authorised, or a branch established, in a Member State not participating in the euro area        should report in the currency of that Member State. The reporting payment service providers        should convert data for values of transactions or fraudulent transactions denominated in a        currency other than the euro currency or the relevant Member State’s official currency into        the currency they should report in, using the relevant exchange rates applied to these        transactions or the average ECB reference exchange rate for the applicable reporting period.	0
2.4.   The payment service provider should report only payment transactions that have been        executed, including those transactions that have been initiated by a payment initiation        service provider. Prevented fraudulent transactions that are blocked before they are        executed due to suspicion of fraud should not be included.	0
2.5.   The payment service provider should report the statistical information with a breakdown in        accordance with the breakdowns specified in Guideline 7 and compiled in Annex 2.	0
2.6.   The payment service provider should identify the applicable data breakdown(s), depending        on the payment service(s) and payment instrument(s) provided, and submit the applicable        data to the competent authority.	0
2.7.   The payment service provider should ensure that all data reported to the competent        authority can be cross-referenced in accordance with Annex 2.	0
2.8.   The payment service provider should allocate each transaction to only one sub-category for        each row of each data breakdown.	0
2.9.   In the case of a series of payment transactions being executed, or fraudulent payment        transactions being executed, the payment service provider should consider each payment        transaction or fraudulent payment transaction in the series to count as one.	0
2.10. The payment service provider can report zero (‘0’) where there were no transactions or       fraudulent transactions taking place for a particular indicator in the reporting period       established. Where the payment service provider cannot report data for a specific       breakdown because that particular data breakdown is not applicable to that PSP, the data       should be reported as ‘NA’.	0
2.11. For the purpose of avoiding double-counting, the payer’s payment service provider should       submit data in its issuing (or initiating) capacity. As an exception, data for card payments       should be reported both by the payer’s payment service provider and by the payee’s                                                                                                   18 FINAL REPORT ON FRAUD REPORTING GUIDELINES UNDER PSD2	0
2.12. In order to avoid double counting when calculating the total transactions and fraudulent       transactions across all payment instruments, the payment service provider that executes       credit transfers initiated by a payment initiation service provider should indicate the       breakdown for the volume and value of the total transactions and fraudulent payment       transactions that have been initiated via a payment initiation service provider when       reporting under Data Breakdown A.	0

22.This section sets out the key elements for developing and implementing an NPE strategy.          Credit institutions should have in place an adequate framework to identify, measure,          manage, monitor and mitigate NPEs, including through workout activities.	0
      23.In the development and implementation of their NPE strategies, credit institutions should          take into account relevant consumer protection considerations and requirements, and          ensure fair treatment of consumers.	0
24.Credit institutions should establish an NPE strategy to target a time-bound reduction of NPEs          over a realistic but sufficiently ambitious time horizon (NPE reduction targets). The NPE          strategy should lay out the credit institution’s approach and objectives regarding effective          management to maximise recoveries and ultimately a reduction in NPE stocks in a clear,          credible and feasible manner for each relevant portfolio. When developing and          implementing the NPE strategy for retail portfolios, credit institutions should consider          provisions aimed at protecting consumers, including Directive 2014/17/EU, 13          Directive 2008/48/EC14 and the EBA Guidelines on arrears and foreclosure.15	0
13Directive 2014/17/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 February 2014 on credit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable property and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 (OJ L 60, 28.2.2014, p. 34). 14Directive 2008/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 on credit agreements for consumers and repealing Council Directive 87/102/EEC (OJ L 133, 22.5.2008, p. 66).	0
   25.The following steps should form the core building blocks of the development and       implementation of the NPE strategy:	0
   26.When credit institutions develop their NPE strategy, they should also consider policies that       aim to ensure the fair treatment of borrowers.	0
27.As a first phase in the formulation and execution of an appropriate NPE strategy, credit       institutions should complete an assessment of the following elements:	0
   28.Credit institutions should perform a comprehensive self-assessment to evaluate the actual       situation and the steps to be taken internally to address any gaps in the internal capabilities       to manage NPEs.	0
   29.Institutions should fully understand and assess:	0
    c) Their operational capacities (processes, tools, data quality, IT/automation, staff/expertise,        decision-making, internal policies and any other relevant area for the implementation of        the strategy) in relation to the various steps involved in the process, including but not        limited to:	0
   30.Credit institutions should perform a comprehensive self-assessment covering at least the       items listed in paragraph 29 on an annual basis to determine strengths, significant gaps and       areas of improvement required to reach NPE reduction targets.	0
   31.Credit institutions should report the outcome of the comprehensive self-assessment to the       institution’s management body and the competent authority.	0
   32.Credit institutions should consider seeking expert views on their operational capabilities to       manage NPEs from the institution’s risk management and control functions or from external       sources on a periodic basis.	0
   33.Credit institutions should assess and consider the current and likely future external operating       conditions and environment when establishing the NPE strategy and associated NPE       reduction targets. The following list of external factors, where appropriate, should be taken       into account by credit institutions when setting the NPE strategy:	0
      34.Credit institutions should be able to calculate a detailed assessment of the impact of the          planned strategy from capital, risk exposure amount, profit or loss, and impairment          perspectives for each of the reduction drivers, and they should assess whether the bank has          identified a strategic process to resolve any shortfalls under different economic scenarios.          The assessment criteria, underlying assumptions and implications should be aligned with the          RAF as well as with the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP).16	0
      35.Credit institutions should include suitable actions in their capital planning to ensure that the          level of available capital will enable a sustainable reduction of NPEs on the balance sheet.	0
36.The NPE strategy should encompass, at a minimum, time-bound quantitative NPE targets and          foreclosed assets targets, supported, where appropriate, by a corresponding comprehensive          operational plan. The development of the NPE strategy should be informed by a selfassessment process and an analysis of the strategic options for the implementation of the          NPE strategy. The NPE strategy and operational plan should be defined and approved by the          management body and reviewed at least annually.	0
      37.Credit institutions should consider including a combination of strategies and options in the          NPE strategy to achieve their objectives over the short, medium and long term. In order to	0
      38.Credit institutions should identify medium- and long-term strategy options for NPE          reductions that may not be achievable immediately, for example due to a lack of immediate          NPE investor demand, which might change in the medium to long term. The operational plan          may therefore need to allow for such changes and require preparations for them, for          example by enhancing the quality of NPE data in order to be ready for future investor          transactions.	0
      39.When a credit institution concludes that none of the above options will lead to a sufficient          NPE reduction in the medium to long term for certain portfolios or individual exposures, this          should be clearly reflected in a timely impairment and write-off approach.	0
      40.Credit institutions aiming to engage in complex processes, such as NPE risk transfer and          securitisation transactions, should conduct robust risk analysis and have adequate risk          control processes in place.17	0
      41.Before commencing the short- to medium-term target-setting process, credit institutions          should establish a view of reasonable long-term NPE levels, both at portfolio level and at          aggregate level. Credit institutions should take into account historic or international          benchmarks in order to define reasonable long-term NPE levels.	0
      42.Credit institutions should include, at a minimum, clearly defined realistic yet ambitious          quantitative targets in their NPE strategy, including for foreclosed assets, where relevant.          These targets should lead to a concrete reduction, gross and net of impairments, in NPEs, at	0
   43.Credit institutions should establish targets as followings:	0
   44.The NPE targets for credit institutions should at a minimum include a projected absolute or       relative NPE reduction, both gross and net of impairments, not only on an overall basis but       also for the main NPE portfolios. Where foreclosed assets are material, a foreclosed assets       strategy should be defined or, at least, foreclosed assets reduction targets should be included       in the NPE strategy.	0
   45.The NPE targets should be aligned with the more granular operational targets. Further       monitoring indicators can be implemented as additional targets, if deemed appropriate.	0
   46.The NPE strategy of the credit institution should be supported by an operational plan, which       should be defined, approved and reviewed by the management body. The operational plan       should clearly define how the credit institution will operationally implement its NPE strategy       over a time horizon of at least one to three years (depending on the type of operational       measures required).	0
   48.The operational plan should have a specific focus on internal factors that could present       impediments to the successful delivery of the NPE strategy.	0
49.The implementation of the NPE strategy operational plan should rely on suitable policies and       procedures, clear ownership and appropriate governance structures, including escalation       procedures, and the operational plan should incorporate wide-ranging change management       measures in order to embed the NPE workout framework as a key element in the corporate       culture.	0
   50.Credit institutions should report material deviations from the plan to the management body       and to the competent authority in a timely manner, with appropriate remediation actions to       be put in place.	0
51.As the execution and delivery of the NPE strategy will involve and depend on many different       areas within the credit institution, it should be embedded in processes at all levels of the       organisation, including strategic and operational, including the risk committee as defined in       Article 76(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU.	0
   52.Credit institutions should emphasise to all relevant staff the key components of the NPE       strategy in line with the approach taken to the institution’s overall strategy and in particular       the risk strategy as defined in Article 76 of Directive 2013/36/EU. This is especially important       if the implementation of the NPE strategy will involve wide-ranging changes to business       procedures.	0
   53.Credit institutions should clearly define and document the roles, responsibilities and formal       reporting lines for the implementation of the NPE strategy and operational plan.	0
   54.Staff and management involved in NPE workout activities should be provided with clear       individual (or team) goals and incentives geared towards reaching the targets agreed in the       NPE strategy and operational plan. Related remuneration policies, career development       objectives and performance monitoring frameworks should take the NPE targets into       account in order to ensure the full engagement of staff and management with NPE reduction       and should also have regard to the fair treatment of consumers. The incentive scheme for       staff and managers in the loan origination/business units should also take into account the       feedback from the workout activities and the quality of the credit institution’s exposures in	0
      55.All relevant components of the NPE strategy should be fully aligned with and integrated into          the business plan and budget, including all the relevant costs associated with the          implementation of the operational plan, and also potential losses stemming from NPE          workout activities.	0
      56.The NPE strategy should be fully embedded in the risk management framework. In that          context, special attention should be paid to:	0
      57.Credit institutions should ensure a high level of monitoring and oversight by the risk          management functions in respect of the formulation and implementation of the NPE strategy          and operational plan.	0
58.In order for credit institutions to be able to address their NPE issues in an efficient and       sustainable manner, an appropriate governance structure and operational set-up should be       in place.	0
   59.This section sets out the key elements of governance and operations in relation to an NPE       workout framework, covering aspects related to steering and decision-making, the NPE       operating model, the internal control framework and NPE monitoring processes.	0
   60.In the implementation of their NPE governance and operations, credit institutions should       take into account relevant consumer protection considerations and requirements, and       ensure fair treatment of consumers.	0
61.The overarching strategy of a credit institution and its implementation should cover the NPE       strategy and operational plan, which should therefore be set, approved and reviewed by the       management body. In particular, the management body should:	0
   62.The management body and senior management should dedicate an amount of their capacity       and devote sufficient time to NPE workout-related matters in line with Article 76 of       Directive 2013/36/EU, in proportion to the risks connected to NPEs within the credit       institution. Credit institutions should establish and document clearly defined, efficient and       consistent decision-making procedures, with adequate second line of defence involvement       at all times.	0
   63.In order to mitigate sufficiently any conflict of interest in managing NPEs, as well as to make       good use of dedicated NPE expertise across the organisation, credit institutions should       establish dedicated NPE workout units (NPE WUs) that are independent from loan origination       activities. This separation of duties approach should encompass not only client relationship       activities (e.g. negotiation of forbearance solutions with clients) but also the decision-making       process. In this context, credit institutions should consider implementing dedicated decisionmaking bodies related to NPE workout (e.g. an NPE committee).	0
   64.Where overlaps with the decision-making bodies, managers or experts involved in the loan       origination process are unavoidable, the institutional framework and internal controls should       ensure that any potential conflicts of interest are sufficiently mitigated.	0
   65.Credit institutions should have arrangements in place to ensure that regular feedback       between loan origination units and NPE WUs is established.	0
   66.When designing an appropriate NPE WU structure, credit institutions should take into       account the specificities of their main NPE portfolios, including the type of exposure (retail,       SME, corporate) and the type of collateral.	0
   67.Credit institutions should consider designing automated processes for NPE WUs for       homogeneous retail NPE portfolios. For corporate NPE portfolios, where relevant, and       depending on the sectoral concentration of the NPEs, credit institutions should consider a       relationship management approach with sectoral specialisation of NPE WU staff. For sole       traders and micro-enterprises, a combination of automated elements and a relationship       management approach should be considered.	0
   68.Smaller and less complex credit institutions (e.g. those that are classified in SREP Category 3       or 4) may have in place dedicated workout functions proportionate to their size, nature,       complexity and risk profile. Credit institutions should ensure that the design of such functions       prevents and eliminates conflict of interest in the management of NPEs.	0
   69.For proportionality purposes, smaller and less complex credit institutions (e.g. those that are       classified in SREP Category 3 or 4), as an alternative to establishing dedicated decision-	0
      70.NPE WUs should be set up to ensure that NPE workout activities and borrower engagements          are tailored to the phases of the NPE life cycle.22 Credit institutions should set up different          NPE WUs for the different phases of the NPE life cycle and also for different portfolios, if          appropriate. All applicable workout stages should receive adequate focus and should be          equipped with sufficiently specialised staff.	0
      71.Credit institutions should consider the following phases in the NPE life cycle, taking into          account also the specificities of the products and the nature of the arrears:	0
     72.Managing foreclosed assets (or other assets stemming from NPEs): collateral repossession         generally commences after other attempts by the credit institution to collect the outstanding         amounts have failed. The credit institution should have a policy in place that describes the         recovery process for foreclosed assets, covering in particular the steps of repossession,         valuation of the collateral and realisation of various types of collateral through appropriate         means.	0
     73.The EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting for expected credit         losses25 describe the policies for credit institutions of grouping exposures with shared credit         risk characteristics. Homogeneous portfolios should be built up in order to tailor treatments         specifically to NPEs. Credit institutions should consider designing customised processes for         each portfolio, with a dedicated expert team taking ownership of each. NPE portfolios should         be analysed with a high degree of granularity, resulting in clearly defined borrower         subportfolios. For these analyses, credit institutions should develop appropriate         management information systems and sufficiently high data quality.	0
     74.A list of potential selection criteria for grouping retail NPEs into portfolios is contained in         Annex 1.	0
     75.For corporate NPE portfolios, grouping by asset class or sector (e.g. commercial real estate,         land and development, shipping, trading businesses) should be considered a key driver for         NPE WU specialisation. These portfolios should then be further divided in line with the NPE         strategy and the level of financial difficulty to ensure that workout activities are sufficiently         focused.	0
     76.Credit institutions should have in place an appropriate organisational framework relative to         their business model and taking into account their risks, including risks stemming from NPEs.         Credit institutions therefore should devote an appropriate and proportionate amount of         management attention and resources to the workout of NPEs and to internal controls on         related processes.	0
     77.Sharing management and resources with other parts of the value chain (e.g. loan origination)         should be carefully reviewed before implementation in order to avoid conflicts of interest         and to ensure sufficient specialisation, as discussed above.	0
     78.Based on the findings of the credit institution’s NPE self-assessment on capabilities, as         referred to in section 4.2.1, credit institutions should regularly review the adequacy of their         internal and external NPE workout resources and address any human resourcing gaps in a         timely fashion. As workout activities may place significant demands on resources, credit         institutions should consider if it is appropriate to choose to use fixed-term contracts,         internal/external outsourcing or joint ventures for NPE workout activities. However, the final         responsibility for these activities remains with the credit institution. In the event that         outsourcing is used, credit institutions should ensure that such outsourcing is arranged in         accordance with the applicable legislation or regulatory requirements.	0
     79.Credit institutions should build up the relevant expertise required for the defined NPE         operating model, including the NPE WUs and internal control functions, in line with the         provisions of the joint ESMA and EBA Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of         members of the management body and key function holders.26 Staff allocated to key NPE         workout tasks should have specific NPE expertise and experience. Credit institutions should         implement adequate and dedicated NPE training, including on consumer protection, and         should design staff development plans to build in-house expertise using available talent.	0
     80.Where it is not possible or efficient to build in-house expertise and infrastructure, the NPE         WUs should have easy access to qualified independent external resources (e.g. property         appraisers, legal advisors, business planners, industry experts) or to dedicated NPE servicing         companies.	0
     81.The credit institution, in alignment with the overall NPE strategy and operational plan, should         implement an appraisal system tailored to the requirements of the NPE WUs. The appraisal         system should be designed in line with the provisions of the EBA Guidelines on sound	0
     82.The performance measurement framework for the management body and relevant         managers should include specific indicators linked to the targets defined in the credit         institution’s NPE strategy and operational plan. The weights given to these indicators within         the overall performance measurement framework should be proportionate to the severity         of the NPE issues faced by the credit institution.	0
     83.Addressing early warnings signals and indicators should be encouraged by credit institutions         through the remuneration policy and incentives framework in order to ensure that prearrears are efficiently addressed and NPE inflows thus effectively reduced.	0
     84.In terms of adequate technical infrastructure, credit institutions should ensure that all NPErelated data are centrally stored in robust and secure IT systems and that they are complete         and up to date throughout the NPE workout process.	0
     85.An adequate technical infrastructure should enable NPE WUs to:	0
      86.The adequacy of the technical infrastructure, including data quality, should be assessed by          an independent internal or external audit function on a regular basis.	0
87.The management body should be responsible for establishing and monitoring the adequacy          and effectiveness of the internal control framework. In particular, effective and efficient          internal control processes should be implemented for the NPE workout framework in order          to ensure full alignment between the NPE strategy and operational plan on the one hand and          the credit institution’s overall business strategy, including the NPE strategy and operational          plan, and risk appetite on the other hand.	0
      88.Internal control functions should regularly submit to the management body written reports          on NPE management highlighting major identified deficiencies. These reports should include,          for each new identified major deficiency, the relevant risks involved, an impact assessment,          recommendations and corrective measures to be taken. Where necessary, the heads of          internal control functions should be able to have access to and report directly to the          management body in its supervisory function to raise concerns and warn the supervisory          function, where appropriate, when specific developments affect or may affect the          institution. This should not prevent the heads of internal control functions from reporting          within regular reporting lines as well.	0
      89.The management body should follow up on the findings of the internal control functions in a          timely and effective manner and require adequate remedial actions. A formal follow-up          procedure on findings and corrective measures taken should be put in place.	0
      90.The internal control framework should involve all three lines of defence in line with the EBA          Guidelines on internal governance.30 The roles of the different functions involved should be          assigned and documented clearly to avoid gaps or overlaps. Key outcomes of second- and          third-line activities as well as defined mitigating actions and progress on those needs should          be reported to the management body regularly.	0
      91.In the implementation of the control framework, larger and more complex credit institutions          should apply all three lines of defence; the second line of defence does not have to be NPE          specific and may be performed by the credit risk (control) function.	0
      92.In the implementation of the control framework, smaller and less complex credit institutions          (e.g. those that are classified in SREP Category 3 or 4) do not necessarily have to have three          fully fledged NPE-specific lines of defence, but they have to ensure that any conflict of          interest is sufficiently mitigated.	0
   93.Credit institutions should ensure that the first line of defence is embedded into the       procedures and processes of the operational units, mainly the NPE WUs, that actually own       and manage the credit institution’s risks in the specific context of NPE workout.	0
   94.In order to ensure that adequate control mechanisms are implemented, credit institutions       should have internal policies in place on the NPE workout framework. The managers of the       operational units are responsible for ensuring that these internal policies are implemented,       including through their incorporation into IT procedures. Annex 4 to these guidelines sets out       key elements of NPE framework-related policies that should be implemented in credit       institutions.	0
   95.Second line of defence functions should perform controls on a continuous basis to check that       NPE management in the first line of defence is operating as intended. To adequately perform       their control tasks, second-line functions require a strong degree of independence from       functions performing business activities, including the NPE WUs, and should have sufficient       resources. They should have an adequate number of qualified staff. The qualifications of staff       should be reassessed on an ongoing basis, and staff should receive training as necessary.	0
   96.The second line of defence controls the implementation of risk management measures by       the NPE WUs and should have a special focus on:	0
   97.Risk control and compliance functions should also provide guidance on the process of       designing and reviewing NPE-related policies and procedures and on the controls being       established across NPE WUs. These functions should be involved in the design and review of       the policies before they are approved by the management body.	0
   98.The third line of defence, the independent internal audit function, should have sufficient NPE       workout expertise to perform its periodic control activities on the efficiency and       effectiveness of the NPE framework, including the first- and second-line controls.	0
   99.With regard to the NPE framework, the internal audit function should, at least, perform       regular assessments to monitor adherence to internal NPE-related policies (see Annex 4) and       to this guidance. This should also include random and unannounced inspections and credit       file reviews.	0
   100. In determining the frequency, scope and scale of the controls to be carried out, credit       institutions should take into account the level of NPEs and whether significant irregularities       and weaknesses have been identified by recent audits.	0
   101. Based on the results of its controls, the internal audit function should make       recommendations to the management body, bringing possible improvements to their       attention.	0
102. The monitoring systems should be based on the NPE targets approved in the NPE strategy       and related operational plan, which are subsequently cascaded down to the operational       targets of the NPE WUs, with feedback loops to pricing of credit risk and provisioning. A       related framework of NPE-related key performance indicators (KPIs) should be developed to       allow the management body and other relevant managers to measure progress.	0
   103. Credit institutions should define and monitor NPE-related KPIs. The NPE-related KPIs,       should include, but not necessarily be limited to (see also Annex 2):	0
   104. Credit institutions should closely monitor the relative and absolute levels of NPEs and FBEs,       as well as foreclosed assets (or other assets stemming from NPE activities) and early arrears,       in their books.	0
   105. Credit institutions should carry out such monitoring activities at transaction/borrower       level, and portfolio or subportfolio levels, as appropriate, considering aspects such as       business line, borrower segment, geographical area, products, concentration risk, level of       collateralisation and type of collateral provided, and debt-service ability.	0
   106. Credit institutions should monitor the level of impairments of NPEs in order to provide the       management body with comprehensive information on coverage. The analysis should       include data on the aggregate level as well as the levels for different NPE portfolios. The       selection of NPE portfolios should consider aspects such as type of exposure, including       secured/unsecured, type of collateral and guarantees, geographical area, number of years       since NPE classification, time to recovery, and the use of the going and gone concern       approach. Coverage movements should also be monitored and reductions clearly explained.	0
   107. Credit institutions should benchmark indicators related to the NPE ratio and coverage       against the available indicators of peers in order to provide the management body with a       clear picture of the competitive position and potential shortcomings.	0
   108. Credit institutions should monitor their deviations from the budget, in order for the       management body to understand the drivers of significant deviations from the plan.	0
   109. Key figures on NPE inflows and outflows should be included in periodic reporting to the       management body, including transfers from/to NPEs, non-performing FBEs, NPEs under       probation, performing FBEs and early arrears (≤ 90 days past due).	0
   110. Credit institutions should consider if it would be useful to establish migration matrices to       track the flow of exposures into and out of non-performing classification.	0
   111. Credit institutions should estimate the migration rates and the quality of the performing       exposures month by month, so that actions can be prioritised and taken promptly to inhibit       deterioration of portfolio quality. Migration matrices can be further broken down by       exposure type (retail mortgage, consumer, real estate), by business unit or by other       subportfolio to identify whether the driver of the flows can be attributed to a specific       subportfolio.	0
   112. In their monitoring activities, credit institutions should use internal information (e.g. from       internal score systems) and external information (e.g. from rating agencies, credit bureaus,       specialised sector research or macroeconomic indicators for specific geographical areas) and       should refer to a particular point in time or observation period. Annex 3 includes examples       of such internal and external information.	0
   113. Once NPE WUs have been established, key operational performance metrics should be       implemented to assess the units’ or employees’ efficiency relative to average performance       and/or standard benchmark indicators. If no such indicators exist or are available, key	0
     114. To resolve or limit the impact of NPEs, credit institutions should explore the possibilities         with regard to granting forbearance measures. Credit institutions should monitor two         aspects of the forbearance activities, efficiency and effectiveness. Section 7 specifies the         requirements relating to the application of forbearance measures.	0
     115. The main objective of forbearance measures should be the return of the borrower to a         sustainable performing repayment status, taking into account the amount due and         minimising expected losses. This objectives should take into account the importance of         ensuring the fair treatment of consumers and compliance with any consumer protection         requirements that may be applicable. The credit institution should monitor the quality of the         forbearance activities to make sure that they are not used to delay impairments or an         assessment that the exposure is uncollectable. The monitoring should cover forbearance         activities in relation to both performing and non-performing exposures.	0
     116. If no sustainable restructuring solution can be reached, credit institutions should still         resolve the NPE. Resolution may involve initiating legal procedures, foreclosing assets, debt         to asset/equity swap, disposal of credit facilities by sale, transferal to an asset management         company or securitisation. Where the price obtained from the foreclosure of immovable         property affects the amount owed by a consumer, credit institutions should take into         account, when deciding on the liquidation measure and next steps, the provisions of         Article 17(5) of Directive 2014/17/EU,31 to the extent applicable.	0
     117. Liquidation activities should be monitored by the credit institution to help inform strategies         and policies. Credit institutions should monitor disposals and monitor realised sales/transfer         prices against net carrying amounts.	0
     118. Credit institutions should monitor the volumes and recovery rates of legal and foreclosure         cases. Performance in this regard should be measured against set targets, in terms of number         of months/years and loss to the institution. In monitoring the actual loss rate, institutions are         expected to build historical time series for each loan portfolio to back up the assumptions         used for impairment review purposes and stress test exercises.	0
     119. For exposures covered by collateral or another type of guarantee, credit institutions should         monitor the time period needed to liquidate the collateral or to enforce a guarantee. Credit         institutions should also monitor potential forced sale haircuts upon liquidation and	0
   120. Monitoring the recovery rates from foreclosure and other legal proceedings should help       credit institutions to reliably assess whether the decision to foreclose will provide a higher       net present value than pursuing a forbearance option. The data regarding the recovery rates       from foreclosures should be monitored on an ongoing basis and feed into potential       amendments to credit institutions’ strategies for handling their debt recovery/legal       portfolios.	0
   121. Credit institutions should also monitor the average duration of legal procedures recently       completed and the average amounts recovered (including related recovery costs) from these       completed procedures.	0
   122. Credit institutions should carefully monitor cases where the debt is swapped with an asset       or equity of the borrower, at least by using volume indicators by type of assets, and ensure       compliance with any limits set by the relevant national regulations on holdings. The use of       this approach as a forbearance measure should be backed by a proper business plan and       limited to assets in relation to which the institution has sufficient expertise and the market       realistically allows the determined value to be extracted from the asset in the short to       medium term. The institution should also make sure that the valuation of the assets is carried       out by qualified and experienced appraisers.	0
   123. Credit institutions should monitor and report to their management bodies the amount of       interest income stemming from NPEs. In addition, a distinction should be made between the       interest payments on NPEs actually received and those not actually received. The evolution       of loss allowances and the related drivers should also be monitored.	0
   124. If foreclosure is a part of a credit institution’s NPE strategy, it should also monitor the       volume, ageing, coverage and flows of foreclosed assets (or other assets stemming from       NPEs) at a sufficient level of granularity to take into account material types of assets. The       performance of the foreclosed assets vis-a-vis the predefined business plan should be       monitored and reported to the management body and other relevant managers on an       aggregate level.	0
125. Credit institutions should use the definitions of forbearance measures and FBEs as stated          in Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 in their risk          management. Forbearance measures should aim to return the borrower to a sustainable          performing repayment status, taking into account the amount due and minimising expected          losses. When deciding on which steps or forbearance measures to take, credit institutions          should take into account the interests of consumers and comply with consumer protection          requirements, including those set out in Article 28 of Directive 2014/17/EU32 and in the EBA          Guidelines on arrears and foreclosure.33 Credit institutions should monitor the efficiency and          effectiveness of forbearance activities.	0
127. Credit institutions should consider using a combination of different forbearance measures,          including both short-term and long-term time horizons in line with the nature and maturity          of the credit facilities. Credit institutions should consider the list of possible forbearance          measures in Annex 5.	0
      128. Credit institutions should use forbearance measures with time horizons shorter than two          years (one year in the case of project finance and the construction of commercial property)          where such measures do not address the resolution of outstanding arrears, unless such          measures are combined with forbearance measures that are longer than two years.	0
      129. Credit institutions should consider forbearance measures with time horizons not greater          than two years (and, where appropriate, for other forbearance measures) when the          borrower meets the following criteria:	0
   130. The contractual terms for any forbearance measure should ensure that the credit       institution has the right to review the agreed forbearance measures if the situation of the       borrower improves and more favourable conditions for the credit institution (with regard to       the forbearance or the original contractual conditions) can therefore be enforced; to this       end, the contract should indicate the specific changes to the forbearance measure to be       applied as a consequence of specific improvements in the situation of the borrower. Credit       institutions should also consider including strict consequences, such as a requirement for       additional collateral, in the contractual terms for borrowers who fail to comply with the       forbearance agreement.	0
   131. Credit institutions should distinguish between viable forbearance measures contributing to       reducing the borrower’s exposure and non-viable forbearance measures.	0
   132. Credit institutions should consider the following factors when assessing the viability of       forbearance measures:	0
   133. The assessment of viability should be based on the financial characteristics of the borrower       and the forbearance measure to be granted at that time. The viability assessment should	0
   134. Credit institutions should develop a policy on their forbearance activities. The policy should       cover at least:	0
   135. Credit institutions should regularly review their forbearance policies and options based on       the collective monitoring of the performance of different forbearance measures, including       the examination of potential causes and instances of re-defaults.	0
   136. Credit institutions should monitor the quality of forbearance activities to make sure that       they are not used to delay an assessment that the exposure is uncollectable. The monitoring       should cover forbearance activities relating to both performing and non-performing       exposures and differentiate between types of forbearance measures and portfolios.	0
   137. Credit institutions should measure the efficiency of the process for granting forbearance       measures and monitor the duration of the decision-making process and the volumes of       forbearance measures at each stage of the granting process.	0
   138. Credit institutions should monitor effectiveness of forbearance measures granted. This       monitoring should measure the degree of success of the forbearance measure and whether       the modified contractual obligations of the borrower are met and the exposure is       performing. The following metrics by portfolio and by type of forbearance measure should       be used:	0
   139. Credit institutions should monitor indicators relating to forbearance activities using a       meaningful breakdown, which could include the type and duration of arrears, the type of       exposure, the probability of recovery, the size of the exposures or the total amount of       exposures to the same borrower or group of connected clients, and the number of       forbearance solutions applied in the past.	0
   140. Before granting any forbearance measures, credit institutions should assess the borrower’s       repayment capacity. This should include an adequate assessment of the borrower’s financial       situation, based on sufficient information and taking into account relevant factors such as       the debt-servicing capacity and overall indebtedness of the borrower or the       property/project.	0
   141. Credit institutions should have adequate policies and procedures in place with a range of       sustainable and effective solutions for the borrower when granting forbearance. The       grouping of exposures into portfolios should be reflected in these policies and procedures,       to enable credit institutions to adopt different forbearance measures for different segments       of borrowers and tailor measures to them.	0
   142. Credit institutions should consider developing decision trees and standardised forbearance       measures for portfolios of homogeneous borrowers with less complex exposures. Decision       trees may help in determining and implementing appropriate and sustainable forbearance       strategies for specific portfolios of borrowers in a consistent manner based on approved       criteria.	0
   143. Credit institutions should use a net present value approach to determine the most suitable       and sustainable workout option for borrowers’ varied circumstances, having regard to the       fair treatment of the consumer, and should compare the net present value of the envisaged       forbearance measure with the net present value of repossession and other available	0
     144. Forbearance contracts and documentation should include a well-defined borrower target         schedule, detailing all necessary targets to be achieved by the borrower in order to repay the         exposure over the course of the contract term. These milestones/targets should be credible,         be appropriately conservative and take account of any potential deterioration in the         borrower’s financial situation. The performance of the forborne borrower, including the         borrower’s compliance with all agreed targets, should be closely monitored by the NPE WU         responsible for granting the forbearance, at least for the duration of the probation period.	0
145. Credit institutions should use the definition of NPE in Annex V to Commission Implementing         Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 in their risk management.	0
     146. This section sets out the key elements of governance and operations in relation to NPE         recognition.	0
147. Credit institutions should recognise exposures as being past due in accordance with         section 4 of the EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default 34 and         Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/171 on the materiality threshold for credit         obligations past due.35	0
148. Credit institutions should recognise exposures as unlikely to pay and identify indications of         unlikeliness to pay in accordance with section 5 of the EBA Guidelines on the application of         the definition of default.	0
     149. Credit institutions should monitor the repayment capacity of borrowers. In the case of         corporate borrowers, this should be assessed at least annually and at key reporting dates at	0
   150. For the purpose of implementing forbearance measures, credit institutions should be able       to identify signs of possible future financial difficulties at an early stage. In order to do so, the       assessment of the financial situation of the borrower should not be limited to exposures with       apparent signs of financial difficulties. An assessment of financial difficulties should also be       conducted for exposures with regard to which the borrower does not have apparent financial       difficulties but in relation to which market conditions have changed significantly in a way that       could impact the borrower’s ability to repay (e.g. bullet loans the repayment of which will       depend on the sale of immovable property or foreign currency loans).	0
   151. The assessment of any financial difficulties on the part of a borrower should be based on       the situation of the borrower only, disregarding collateral or any guarantees provided by       third parties. When assessing the financial difficulties of the borrower, credit institutions, in       accordance with Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, should       consider at least the following rebuttable circumstances:	0
   152. Exposures should not be identified as forborne when concessions are made to borrowers       who are not in financial difficulties. Credit institutions should distinguish, based on a detailed       financial assessment, between renegotiations or rollovers granted to borrowers not in       financial difficulties and forbearance measures such as concessions granted to borrowers in	0
   153. Granting new conditions such as a new interest rate more favourable than the rate       borrowers with a similar risk profile could obtain may be considered an indication of such a       concession when the credit institution determines that the reason for the new rate is the       financial difficulties of the borrower. The provision of more favourable new conditions than       those practised by the market should not be considered a prerequisite for the identification       of concessions and therefore forbearance. In line with Annex V to Commission Implementing       Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, when a borrower is in financial difficulties, a change in       conditions in line with what other borrowers with a similar risk profile could get from the       credit institution should qualify as a concession, including when borrowers are included in       public forbearance schemes that are offered by credit institutions.	0
   154. Borrowers may request modifications in the contractual conditions of their loans without       facing or being about to face difficulties in meeting their financial commitments. Credit       institutions should perform an assessment of the borrower’s financial situation when such       modifications to contractual conditions have an impact on payment performance.	0
   155. When granting forbearance measures to performing exposures, credit institutions should       assess whether these measures lead to a need to reclassify the exposure as non-performing.       Granting forbearance measures to NPEs does not clear their non-performing status: the       exposures should continue to be identified as non-performing for at least one year of the cure       period after the granting of the forbearance measures, as specified in Annex V to Commission       Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 and in section 7.3.3.	0
   156. When assessing if FBEs should be classified as non-performing, credit institutions should       assess if exposures:	0
   157. Credit institutions should reclassify NPEs, including FBEs, as performing in accordance with       Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014. Credit institutions       should perform a financial analysis of the borrower to establish the absence of concerns       regarding the borrower’s ability to pay its credit obligations.	0
   158. Credit institutions’ policies for the reclassification of non-performing FBEs should specify       practices for dispelling concerns regarding the borrower’s ability to comply with the postforbearance conditions set out in Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)       No 680/2014. These policies should establish criteria in terms of payments made during the       cure period of at least one year and define the borrower’s ability to comply with postforbearance conditions (to the extent that full repayment of the debt is likely) without being       reliant on the realisation of collateral at least by demonstrating payments of a not       insignificant amount of principal. These policies should require payments of both principal       and interest.	0
   159. In addition, where a borrower has other exposures to a credit institution that are not the       subject of a forbearance measure, the credit institution should consider the impact and the       performance of these exposures in its assessment of the borrower’s ability to comply with       post-forbearance conditions. The consideration of arrears should not change the level of       application of non-performing status, in accordance with Annex V to Commission       Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, and only exposures to which forbearance       measures have been applied should be identified as FBEs.	0
   160. The existence of contract terms that extend the repayment period, such as grace periods       for the principal, should confirm the classification of these FBEs as non-performing until the       requirements of Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 have       been satisfied. The fact that the one-year cure period has elapsed should not automatically       lead to reclassification to performing unless regular payments have been made over these	0
   161. Once FBEs are classified as performing, either because they have met the conditions for       being reclassified from the non-performing category or because the granting of forbearance       measures did not lead to the classification of the exposure as non-performing, they should       continue to be identified as forborne until all the conditions for the discontinuation of the       classification of exposures as forborne under paragraph 256 of Annex V to Commission       Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 have been met.	0
   162. Credit institutions’ policies for identifying performing FBEs should specify practices for       dispelling concerns regarding the borrower’s financial difficulties. Credit institutions’ policies       should require the borrower to have settled, by means of regular payments, an amount equal	0
      163. In accordance with paragraph 260 of Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)          No 680/2014, new forbearance measures granted to performing FBEs that have been          reclassified out of the non-performing category will entail the reclassification of these          transactions to the non-performing category. The same should apply when these exposures          become more than 30 days past due.	0
164. Credit institutions should adopt adequate mechanisms and procedures, in accordance with          section 8 of the EBA Guidelines on the definition of default, for the harmonised          implementation of the definition in all subsidiaries and branches. This will ensure that the          identification of NPEs is consistent at entity and banking group levels.	0
      165. Credit institutions’ policies should ensure consistent treatment of individual clients and          groups of connected clients as defined in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the EBA Guidelines          on connected clients36 and the EBA Guidelines on the definition of default. Credit institutions’          policies should also ensure a consistent assessment of the underlying legal relationships          between legal entities across a group of connected clients. In view of possible contagion,          credit institutions should, whenever feasible, apply a group perspective when assessing the          status of a borrower’s exposure as non-performing, unless it is affected by isolated disputes          that are unrelated to the solvency of the counterparty.	0
      166. In accordance with the EBA Guidelines on the definition of default, credit institutions          should keep a register of all classification criteria.	0
167. Credit institutions should estimate loss allowances for NPEs and FBEs subject to impairment         in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting         for expected credit losses.	0
     168. This section sets out the key elements of governance and operations in relation to NPE         impairment measurement and write-offs.	0
169. In accordance with the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting         for expected credit losses,37 uncollectability should be recognised in the appropriate period         through loss allowances or write-offs. When the credit institution has no reasonable         expectation of recovering contractual cash flow of the exposure it should lead to a partial or         full write-off of the exposure (IFRS 9.B3.2.16.r).	0
     170. A write-off may be done before legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have         been concluded in full. A write-off should not be considered to mean that the credit         institution has forfeited the legal right to recover the debt; a credit institution’s decision to         forfeit the legal claim on the debt is debt forgiveness.	0
     171. Write-offs constitute a de-recognition event (IFRS 9.5.4.4). If cash or other assets are         eventually collected, these collections should be directly recognised as income in the         statement of profit or loss.	0
     172. Credit institutions should maintain detailed records of all NPE write-offs performed on a         portfolio-level basis.	0
173. Credit institutions should include in their internal policies guidance on the timeliness of         impairments and write-offs, acknowledging external circumstances and factors such as         ongoing judicial procedures. In particular for exposures or parts of exposures that are not         covered by collateral, credit institutions should consider suitable maximum periods for full         impairment, coverage and write-off. For parts of exposures covered by collateral, the         establishment of a minimum impairment level should take the type of collateral into account.         Empirical evidence should be applied when calibrating the impairment and write-off periods         referred to above. When assessing the recoverability of NPEs and in determining internal	0
       a) Exposures with prolonged arrears: different thresholds may be appropriate for different           portfolios. Credit institutions should assess the recoverability of NPEs if the borrower has           been in arrears for a prolonged period of time. If, following this assessment, it is concluded           that there is no reasonable expectation of recovering an exposure or part of an exposure,           a full or partial write-off should be performed.	0
       b) Exposures under an insolvency procedure: where the collateralisation of the exposure is           low, legal expenses often absorb a significant portion of the proceeds from the bankruptcy           procedure, and therefore estimated recoveries can be expected to be very low.	0
       c) A partial write-off may be justified when there is evidence that the borrower is unable to           repay the amount of the exposure in full, meaning that there is a reasonable expectation           of recovering a part of the exposure.	0
174. Credit institutions should adopt, document and adhere to sound policies, procedures and          controls for assessing and measuring loss allowances and write-off on NPEs in accordance          with the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting for expected          credit losses. Credit institutions should back-test their loss allowance estimations against          actual losses.	0
      175. These methodologies should also include policies and procedures on write-offs and          recoveries as defined in the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and          accounting for expected credit losses. The policy on write-offs should include indicators used          to assess expectations of recovery and detailed information on those exposures that have          been written off but are still subject to enforcement activity.	0
      176. In accordance with the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting          for expected credit losses, credit institutions should have in place common processes,          systems, tools and data.	0
      177. A credit institution’s internal audit function should verify the methodologies used in          accordance with the EBA Guidelines on internal governance.38	0
178. This section sets out the key elements for collateral valuation of immovable and movable       property pledged for NPEs.	0
   179. A credit institution should have in place a written policy and procedures governing the       valuation of property collateral. The policy and procedures should be fully aligned with the       credit institution’s RAF.	0
   180. The policy and procedures should cover the valuation of all immovable and movable       property collateral irrespective of its eligibility for prudential purposes in accordance with       the requirements of Article 208 and Article 210 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.	0
   181. The policy and procedures should be approved by the management body and should be       reviewed at least on an annual basis.	0
   182. Credit institutions should monitor and review the valuations performed by internal or       external appraisers on a regular basis as set out in this section.	0
   183. Credit institutions should develop and implement a robust internal quality assurance policy       and procedures for valuations conducted internally and externally, considering the following:	0
   184. In addition, the internal audit function should regularly review the consistency and quality       of the valuation policy and procedures, the independence of the appraiser selection process       and the appropriateness of the valuations carried out by both external and internal       appraisers.	0
   185. Credit institutions should monitor the value of immovable property collateral on a frequent       basis and at a minimum as specified in Article 208(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.	0
   186. Indexation or similar methods may be used to monitor the value of a collateral and identify       the collaterals requiring revaluation. This should be in line with the institution’s policy and       provided that the collateral to be assessed is susceptible to accurate assessment by such       methods.	0
   188. Valuations and revaluations of immovable property collateral should be performed on an       individual and a property-specific basis. Valuations and revaluations of immovable property       collateral should not be carried out using a statistical model as the sole means of undertaking       the review of the property valuation.	0
   189. Competent authorities should define a common threshold for the individual valuation and       revaluation of the collaterals used for NPEs by an independent appraiser. This threshold       should be applicable to all credit institutions in the authority’s jurisdiction and should be       publicly disclosed.	0
   190. All valuations of immovable property, including updated valuations, should be performed       by an independent and qualified appraiser, internal or external, who possesses the necessary       qualifications, ability and experience to execute a valuation, as specified in Article 208(3)(b)       and Article 229 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.	0
   191. For the purposes of external appraisals, credit institutions should establish a panel of       independent and qualified appraisers, based on the criteria set out below. The appraisers’	0
   192. Credit institutions should ensure that external appraisers on the panel have adequate and       valid professional indemnity insurance.	0
   193. The credit institution should ensure that each qualified appraiser on the panel:	0
   194. A panel of appraisers should contain expertise in various areas of the property sector       appropriate to the lending business of the credit institution and the location of lending.	0
   195. In order to mitigate any conflict of interest sufficiently, credit institutions should ensure       that all internal and external appraisers who are going to carry out the actual appraisal of a       given property and their first-degree relatives meet the following requirements:	0
   196. Credit institutions should ensure adequate rotation of appraisers, i.e. two sequential       individual valuations of the immovable property by the same appraiser should result in the       rotation of the appraiser, resulting in the appointment of either a different internal appraiser       or a different external appraisal provider.	0
197. For prudential purposes, credit institutions should update valuations of all secured       exposures in accordance with the requirements of Article 208(3) and Article 210(c) of       Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.	0
   198. The group of collaterals that are subject to individual valuations and revaluations on a       regular basis should be updated at the time when the exposure is classified as nonperforming and at least annually while it continues to be classified as such. Credit institutions       should make sure that, for the collateral subject to indexation or other similar methods, the       indexation is updated at least annually.	0
   199. For properties with an updated individual valuation that has taken place within the past	0
   200. Credit institutions should carry out more frequent monitoring where the market is subject       to significant negative changes and/or where there are signs of significant decline in the value       of the individual collateral.	0
   201. Therefore, credit institutions should define criteria in their collateral valuation policy and       procedures for determining if a significant decline in collateral value has taken place. Where       possible, these will include quantitative thresholds for each type of collateral, based on the       observed empirical data and any relevant qualitative credit institution experience, bearing in       mind relevant factors such as market price trends or the opinion of independent appraisers.	0
   205. For movable property, credit institutions should, in accordance with the requirements of       Article 199(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, periodically assess the liquidity of the       property. If there is material volatility in the market prices, the institution should       demonstrate that the valuation of the collateral is sufficiently conservative.	0
     206. For movable property, credit institutions should, in accordance with the requirements of         Article 210 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, conduct a sufficient legal review confirming the         enforceability of the collateral, including an assessment of the legal right to enforce and         liquidate the collateral in the event of default, within a reasonable timeframe.	0
     207. Overall valuations based only on the discounted replacement cost should not be used. For         income-generating properties, a market-comparable or discounted cash flow approach can         be used.	0
     208. Property collateral should be valued in accordance with applicable international, European         and national standards.39	0
     209. Credit institutions should estimate discounted cash flow in a prudential manner and in line         with applicable accounting standards.	0
     210. Calculation of discounted cash flow should take into account cases where:	0
     211. When the estimation is based on the assumption that the operating cash flow of the         borrower will continue, including cash flow being received from the collateral, updated and         reliable information on cash flow is required.	0
     212. When the estimation is based on the assumption that the operating cash flow of the         borrower will cease, the future sale proceeds from collateral execution should be adjusted         to take into account the appropriate liquidation costs and market price discount.	0
     213. In addition to the above liquidation costs, a market price discount, if appropriate, should         be applied to the updated valuation as outlined below.	0
     214. The property price at the time of liquidation should take into account current and expected         market conditions.	0
     215. Time-to-sale considerations in connection with the disposal of mortgaged properties         should also be included, based on debt enforcement practices and experiences from judicial         proceedings at national level and on empirical evidence, and back-tested accordingly. These	0
   216. The execution of collateral may include both consensual and non-consensual (forced)       liquidation strategies.	0
   217. The liquidation cost discount should reflect the manner of collateral execution, i.e. whether       it is consensual or non-consensual.	0
   218. The market price discount should reflect the liquidity of the market and the liquidation       strategy. It should not reflect fire sale conditions unless the anticipated liquidation strategy       actually involves a fire sale.	0
   219. Credit institutions should apply adequate market price discounts for the purposes of IFRS 9,       for the calculation of regulatory capital and for risk control purposes. A market price discount       may be close to zero only for highly liquid and non-distressed collateral types that are not       affected by any significant correlation risks.	0
   220. All credit institutions should develop their own liquidation cost and market price discount       assumptions based on observed empirical evidence. If insufficient empirical evidence is       available, discount assumptions should be based on, at a minimum, liquidity, passage of time,       and the quality/ageing of the appraisal. If a credit institution faces the situation of a frozen       property market and only a small number of properties have been sold or the sales history       has to be considered insufficient, a more conservative market price discount should apply.	0
221. In estimating cash flow from property collateral liquidation, credit institutions should use       appropriate and credible assumptions. In addition, credit institutions should pay attention to       the requirements for valuing cash flow under IFRS 13 on fair value measurements. In       particular, financial institutions should comply with the following requirements:	0
   222. When using the value of collateral in assessing the recoverable amount of the exposure, at       least the following should be documented:	0
   223. When the observable market price is used to assess the recoverable amount of the       exposure, the amount, source and date of the observable market price should also be       documented.	0
   224. Credit institutions should be able to substantiate the assumptions used when assessing the       recoverable amount by providing to the competent authority, if requested, details on the       property market value, the market price discount, legal and selling expenses applied, and the       term used for the time to liquidation. Credit institutions should be able to fully justify their       assumptions, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and explain the drivers of their       expectations, taking past and current experience into account.	0
225. Credit institutions should demonstrate via sound back-testing that the assumptions used       when assessing the recoverable amount were reasonable and grounded in observed       experience. In this context, credit institutions should regularly back-test their valuation       history (last valuation before the exposure was classified as non-performing) against their       sales history (net sales price of collateral). Depending on the size and business model of the       credit institution, it should differentiate by collateral type, valuation model/approach, type	0
   226. Alternatively, credit institutions using the advanced internal ratings based (A-IRB) approach       may use secured loss given default (LGD) to determine haircuts.	0
227. Credit institutions should have databases of transactions to enable the proper assessment,       monitoring and control of credit risk, to respond to requests from management and       supervisors, and to enable the provision of information in periodic reports and other timely       and comprehensive documentation. In particular, databases should comply with the       following requirements:	0
   228. These databases should include all the relevant information on properties and other       collateral for the credit institutions’ transactions and on the links between collateral and       specific transactions.	0
229. Credit institutions should strongly consider classifying foreclosed assets as non-current       assets held for sale under IFRS 5. This accounting treatment implies that the asset must be       available for immediate sale in its present condition (IFRS 5.7), that the management body       should approve an individual plan to sell the asset within a short timeframe (normally one       year) and that an active sales policy should be pursued (IFRS 5.8); thus, it favours recoveries.	0
   230. Foreclosed assets received should be valued at the lower of:	0
   231. When fair value is not obtained by reference to an active market but is based on a valuation       technique (either level 2 or level 3), some adjustments are necessary, in particular as a result       of two factors:                                                                                                    57 FINAL REPORT – GUIDELINES ON MANAGEMENT OF NON-PERFORMING AND FORBORNE EXPOSURES	0
    b) The volume or level of activity of the markets in relation to these assets. The credit        institution’s previous experience of the entity in realisations and of the differences        between amounts arrived at using the valuation technique and the final amounts obtained        in realisations should be incorporated into the calculation. The assumptions made in order        to measure this adjustment may be documented, and should be available to the supervisor        on request. Illiquidity discounts may be considered.	0
   232. When credit institutions’ foreclosed assets are still under construction and it is decided to       complete construction before selling the asset, they should demonstrate the merits of such       a strategy and the cost should not exceed the fair value less costs to complete and sell the       asset taking into account an appropriate illiquidity discount as described above.	0
   233. When a foreclosed asset has exceeded the average holding period for similar assets for       which active sales policies are in place, credit institutions should revise the illiquidity discount       applied in the valuation process described above, increase it accordingly. In these       circumstances, the credit institution should refrain from recognising write-backs/reversals of       existing accumulated impairment on the asset, as its prolonged presence on the balance       sheet provides evidence that the credit institution is unable to sell the asset at an increased       valuation.	0
   234. The frequency of valuation of foreclosed assets and the applicable procedures should       follow the treatment of immovable property as set out in sections 9.1.2 and 9.2.	0
235. As part of their ongoing engagement with credit institutions under the SREP, competent       authorities should monitor the application of these guidelines by the credit institutions, in       particular the development and implementation of NPE strategies and related governance       and operational frameworks as described in sections 4 and 5. Competent authorities’       assessments should include, but not be limited to, whether the credit institution’s NPE       strategy:	0
   236. If the competent authority concludes that the NPE strategy of a credit institution clearly       lacks one or more of the elements listed in points (a) to (e) of paragraph 235, it should be       considered a serious shortcoming of the NPE strategy. In this case, competent authorities       should require the immediate revision of the NPE strategy.	0
   237. If the outcome of the competent authority’s assessment is that the requirements of       point (a) to (e) of paragraph 236 are broadly fulfilled by the NPE strategy, but some       deficiencies are identified, the competent authority should ensure that credit institutions       present an action plan on how to address the deficiencies and establish an effective and       timely NPE management framework.	0
   238. Competent authorities should apply supervisory evaluation proportionately, taking into       account the specificities of the institutions (e.g. in terms of size, nature and complexity). In       their SREP assessments of NPE strategies and the supporting governance and operational       arrangements, the competent authorities should consider also the business models of the       institutions, in particular when the sole business of the institution is the purchase and sale of       NPEs.	0
      239. Proportionality in terms of the supervisory assessment of the NPE strategy of a smaller and          less complex credit institution (e.g. an SREP Category 3 or 4 institution40) can be achieved by          aligning the assessment with the SREP engagement model, which ensures a risk-based          approach to supervision and takes into account the systemic importance of global and          domestic institutions.	0
      240. Competent authorities should challenge credit institutions’:	0
      241. Considering the importance of early detection and prevention of deteriorating credit          quality, competent authorities should assess whether the early warning mechanisms are          implemented in the credit institutions’ internal procedures.	0
      242. Competent authorities should assess if credit institutions:	0
   243. Competent authorities should ensure that credit institutions have appropriate written       policies and procedures in place regarding the valuation of property, as described in       section 9. In particular, competent authorities should verify that these policies cover all       immovable and movable property types that are used to secure credit exposures, the criteria       for the application of individual versus indexed valuation and the requirements with regard to       eligible appraisers.	0
   244. If credit institutions report material deviations from the operational plan in accordance       with section 4.4, competent authorities should assess whether the proposed remediation       actions are sufficient to eliminate the deviation from the plan. The competent authority       should require further actions of the credit institution if it is concerned about the       effectiveness of the proposed actions.	0
   245. The requirements set out above regarding the supervisory evaluation of the management       of NPEs and FBEs supplement and further specify the assessment of NPEs and FBEs as part       of credit risk management put forward in the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and       methodologies for the SREP. The findings of this supervisory evaluation would feed into the       assessment of credit risk under Title 6.2 of the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and       methodologies for the SREP and would inform credit risk scores.	0
2.1. When establishing the provisional list, competent authorities should give priority to those      services that satisfy both criteria (i.e. in area C of Figure 1).	0
2.2. In a second step, since the criteria are not strictly cumulative, competent authorities should      also consider services that only satisfy one of the criteria (i.e. in areas A or B) for inclusion in the      provisional list.	0
2.3. Competent authorities should only use other criteria as an exception, for market-specific      issues. In doing so, competent authorities should be able to justify the methodology used,      supply supporting data and provide the reasoning behind their decisions.	0
2.4. Competent authorities should consider the service provided as a single service, irrespective of      the potential for providers to differentiate costs according to factors such as channels of      usage or the identity of the receiving payment service provider.	0
3.1. Competent authorities should respond to the Commission and to the EBA using the template in      the Annex. Competent authorities should send the responses to the following dedicated      mailboxes	0
4.1. Competent authorities should base their decisions on relevant data. Competent authorities      may make use of data from a wide range of sources, provided the data is reliable.	0
4.2. Competent authorities should ensure that they are able to provide supporting data to justify      any decision to include or exclude particular services from their list.	0
5.1. Competent authorities shall submit the provisional list in accordance with Article 3(3) of      Directive 2014/92/EU by 18 September 2015.	0
11.When applying Article 4(1)(39)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions are required to    assume that two or more clients constitute a single risk when there is a control relationship    between them.	0
12.In exceptional cases, where institutions are able to demonstrate that no single risk exists despite    the existence of a control relationship among clients, institutions should document the relevant    circumstances that justify this case in a detailed and comprehensible manner. For example, in    specific cases where a special purpose entity that is controlled by another client (e.g. an    originator) is fully ring-fenced and bankruptcy remote – so that there is no possible channel of    contagion, and hence no single risk, between the special purpose entity and the controlling entity    – it may be possible to demonstrate that no single risk exists (see scenario C 1 in the annex).	0
13.Institutions should apply the concept of control as defined in Article 4(1)(37) of Regulation (EU)    No 575/2013 as follows:	0
14.Given that the decisive factor for the assessment of the existence of a control relationship is the    accounting criteria or indicators of control set out in paragraph 13(a), (b) and (c), institutions    should group two or more clients on account of a relationship of control, as described in this    section, even where these clients are not included in the same consolidated financial statements    because exemptions apply to them under the relevant accounting rules, for example under    Article 23 of Directive 2013/34/EU.	0
15.Institutions should group two or more clients into a group of connected clients on account of a    relationship of control among these clients regardless of whether or not the exposures to these    clients are exempted from the application of the large exposures limit under Article 400(1) and (2)    of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or in accordance with exemptions under national rules    implementing Article 493(3) of that Regulation.	0
16.In line with the definition of ‘group of connected clients’ under the last subparagraph of    Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions may assess the existence of a group    of connected clients separately for each of the persons directly controlled by or directly    interconnected with the central government (‘alternative approach’). 14	0
17.The same provision allows for a partial application of the alternative approach, assessing    separately the natural or legal persons directly controlled by or directly interconnected with the    central government (see scenario CG 1 in the annex).	0
19.Where the entities directly controlled by or directly interconnected with the central government    are economically dependent on each other, they should form separate groups of connected    clients (excluding the central government), in addition to the groups of connected clients formed    in accordance with the alternative approach (see scenario CG 4 in the annex).	0
20. In line with the last sentence of the last subparagraph of Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU)    No 575/2013, this section of the guidelines is also applicable to regional governments or local    authorities to which Article 115(2) of that Regulation applies, and natural or legal persons directly    controlled by or interconnected with these regional governments or local authorities.	0
14   In accordance with Article 400(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, asset items constituting claims on central governments, which unsecured would be assigned a 0% risk weight under the standardised approach, are exempted from the application of Article 395(1) (limits to large exposures) of the same regulation.	0
21.When assessing interconnectedness among their clients based on economic dependency, in    accordance with Article 4(1)(39)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should take into    account the specific circumstances of each case, in particular whether the financial difficulties or    the failure of a client would lead to funding or repayment difficulties for another client (see    scenarios E 1, E 2, E 3 and E 4 in the annex).	0
22.Where an institution is able to demonstrate that the financial difficulties or the failure of a client    would not lead to funding or repayment difficulties for another client, these clients do not need to    be considered a single risk. In addition, two clients do not need to be considered a single risk if a    client is economically dependent on another client in a limited way, meaning that the client can    easily find a replacement for the other client.	0
23.Institutions should consider, in particular, the following situations when assessing economic    dependency:	0
24.Institutions should also consider the non-exhaustive list of situations in paragraph 23 when    assessing connections among shadow banking entities. 16 Institutions should give due    consideration to the fact that relationships between entities falling under the definition of    shadow banking entities will most likely consist not of equity ties but rather of a different type of    relationship, i.e. situations of de facto control or relationships characterised by contractual    obligations, implicit support or potential reputational risk (e.g. sponsorship or even branding).	0
25.Where an institution’s client is economically dependent on more than one client, which are not    dependent on each other, the institution should include the latter clients in separate groups of    connected clients (together with the dependent client).	0
26.Institutions should form a group of connected clients where two or more of their clients are    economically dependent on an entity, even if this entity is not a client of the institution.	0
27.Institutions should group two or more clients into a group of connected clients on account of    economic dependency among these clients regardless of whether or not the exposures to these    clients are exempted from the application of the large exposures limit under Article 400(1) and (2)    of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or in accordance with exemptions under national rules    implementing Article 493(3) of that Regulation.	0
28.Institutions should consider situations where the funding problems of one client are likely to    spread to another on account of a one-way or two-way dependency on the same funding source.    This does not include cases where clients get funding from the same market (e.g. the market for    commercial paper) or where clients’ dependency on their existing source of funding is caused by	0
16   As defined in the EBA guidelines on limits on exposures to shadow banking entities that carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework under Article 395(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013: https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/large-exposures/guidelines-on-limits-on-exposures-to-shadow-banking	0
29.Institutions should consider cases where the common source of funding depended on is provided    by the institution itself, its financial group or its connected parties (see scenarios E 5 and E 6 in the    annex) 17. Being clients of the same institution does not in itself create a requirement to group the    clients if the institution providing funding can be easily replaced.	0
30.Institutions should also assess any contagion or idiosyncratic risk that could emerge from the    following situations:	0
31.Institutions should first identify which clients are connected via control in accordance with    Article 4(1)(39)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (‘control group’) and which clients are    connected via economic dependency in accordance with Article 4(1)(39)(b) of the same    Regulation. Subsequently, institutions should assess whether the identified groups of connected    clients need to be (partially) connected themselves (e.g. whether groups of clients connected on    account of economic dependency need to be grouped together with a control group).	0
32.In their assessment, institutions should consider each case separately, i.e. identify the possible    chain of contagion (‘domino effect’) based on the individual circumstances (see scenarios C/E 1    and C/E 2 in the annex).	0
33.Where clients that are part of different control groups are interconnected via economic    dependency, all entities for which a chain of contagion exists need to be grouped into one group    of connected clients. Downstream contagion should always be assumed when a client is    economically dependent and is itself the head of a control group (see scenario C/E 3 in the annex).    Upstream contagion of clients that control an economically dependent entity should be assumed    only when this controlling client is also economically dependent on the entity that constitutes the    economic link between the two controlling groups (see scenario C/E 4 in the annex).	0
34.Institutions should have a thorough knowledge of their clients and their clients’ relationships.    Institutions should also ensure that their staff understand and apply these guidelines.	0
35.Identification of possible connections among clients should be an integral part of an institution’s    credit granting and surveillance process. The management body and senior management should    ensure that adequate processes for the identification of connections among clients are    documented and implemented.	0
36.Institutions should identify all control relationships among their clients and document as    appropriate. Institutions should also investigate, and document as appropriate, any potential    economic dependencies among their clients. Institutions should take reasonable steps and use    readily available information to identify these connections. If, for example, an institution becomes    aware that clients have been considered interconnected by another institution (e.g. because of    the existence of a public register), it should take into account that information.	0
37.The efforts that institutions put into the investigation of economic dependencies among their    clients should be proportionate to the size of the exposures. Therefore, institutions should    strengthen their investigations, by extensive research of any type of ‘soft information’ as well as    information that goes beyond the institutions’ clients, in all cases where the sum of all exposures    to one individual client exceeds 5% of Tier 1 capital. 18	0
38.To assess grouping requirements based on a combination of control and economic dependency    relationships, institutions should collect information on all entities forming a chain of contagion.    Institutions might not be able to identify all clients that constitute a single risk if there are    interconnections that stem from entities that are not in a business relationship with the    institution and are therefore unknown to the institution (see scenario Mm 1 in the annex).    However, if an institution becomes aware of interconnections via entities outside its clientele, it    should use this information when assessing connections.	0
39.Control and management procedures for identifying connected clients should be subject to    periodic review to ensure their appropriateness. Institutions should also monitor changes to    interconnections, at least in the context of their periodic loan reviews and when a substantial    increase to a loan is planned.	0
18   The threshold refers to the institution’s Tier 1 capital for the purposes of applying these guidelines on an individual basis. The threshold refers to the Tier 1 capital of the group of the institution for the purposes of applying these guidelines on a subconsolidated or consolidated basis.	0
1. Institutions should consider that investments in venture capital firms referred to in point (a) of    Article 128(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 include, at a minimum, any investment that    meets both of the following conditions:	0
2. Institutions should consider that investments in private equity referred to in point (c) of    Article 128(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 include, at a minimum, any investment that    meets both of the following conditions:	0
3. The scope of the exercise of identifying items associated with particularly high risk that are not    already covered by Article 128(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should cover all exposure    classes, with a particular emphasis on the exposure classes referred to in points (g), (p) and (q)    of Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.	0
4. Institutions should consider as items associated with particularly high risk, from among those    referred to in paragraph 3, at a minimum, those exposures that exhibit levels and ranges of risk    drivers that are not common to other obligors or transactions of the same exposure class.	0
5. For the purposes of paragraph 4, institutions should consider, at a minimum, all of the following    exposures as exhibiting levels and ranges of risk drivers that are not common to other obligors    or transactions of the same exposure class:	0
6. All equity exposures to a given issuer should be considered whether to be classified as items    associated with particularly high risk where either of the following conditions is met:	0
7. Where institutions identify any types of exposures carrying a particularly high risk of loss in    accordance with the conditions set out in Article 128(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, other    than those identified in accordance with paragraph 5 or 6, institutions should notify the    competent authorities in their jurisdiction, together with a brief description of the main    characteristics of these exposures. The competent authorities should, in turn, notify the EBA.	0
11. In order to apply these guidelines for the first time, institutions that use the IRB Approach     should assess and accordingly adjust, where necessary, their rating systems so that the     estimates of risk parameters reflect the new definition of default according to these     guidelines by applying the following:	0
12. The changes referred to in paragraph 11, which are applied to the rating systems as a result of     the application of these guidelines, are required to be verified by the internal validation     function and classified according to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014, and,     depending on this classification, they are required to be notified or approved by the relevant     competent authority.	0
13. Institutions that use the IRB Approach, and which need to obtain prior permission from     competent authorities in accordance with Article 143 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and     Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 2 in order to incorporate these     guidelines by the deadline referred to in paragraph 10, should agree with their competent	0
14. After IRB institutions have started collecting data according to the new definition of default as     provided in these guidelines, in the course of their regular revision of risk estimates referred     to in Article 179(1)(c) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, those institutions should extend or,     where justified, move the window of historical data used for the risk quantification to include     new data. Until an adequate time period with homogenous default definition is reached,     those IRB institutions, during their regular revisions of the risk parameter estimates, should     assess the adequacy of the level of the margin of conservatism referred to in point (b) of     paragraph 11.	0
15. Sections 3.3.2.1. and 3.4.4. of the CEBS Guidelines on the implementation, validation and     assessment of Advanced Measurement (AMA) and Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approaches     (GL10) published on 4 April 2006 are repealed with effect from 1 January 2021.	0
16. For the purposes of the application of point (b) of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No     575/2013, where any amount of principal, interest or fee has not been paid at the date it was     due, institutions should recognise this as the credit obligation past due. Where there are     modifications of the schedule of credit obligations, as referred to in point (e) of Article 178(2)     of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the institution’s policies should clarify that the counting of     days past due should be based on the modified schedule of payments.	0
17. Where the credit arrangement explicitly allows the obligor to change the schedule, suspend     or postpone the payments under certain conditions and the obligor acts within the rights     granted in the contract, the changed, suspended or postponed instalments should not be     considered past due, but the counting of days past due should be based on the new schedule     once it is specified. Nevertheless if the obligor changes the schedule, suspends or postpones     the payments, the institutions should analyse the reasons for such a change and assess the     possible indications of unlikeliness to pay, in accordance with Articles 178(1) and (3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Section 5 of these guidelines.	0
18. Where the repayment of the obligation is suspended because of a law allowing this option or     other legal restrictions, the counting of days past due should also be suspended during that	0
19. Where the repayment of the obligation is the subject of a dispute between the obligor and     the institution, the counting of days past due may be suspended until the dispute is resolved,     where at least one of the following conditions is met:	0
20. Where the obligor changes due to an event such as a merger or acquisition of the obligor or     any other similar transaction, the counting of days past due should start from the moment a     different person or entity becomes obliged to pay the obligation. The counting of days past     due is, instead, unaffected by a change in the obligor’s name.	0
21. The calculation of the sum of all amounts past due that are related to any credit obligation of     the obligor to the institution, parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries to this obligor and     which institutions are required to calculate for the purpose of comparison with the     materiality threshold set by the competent authority in accordance with point (d) of Article     178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should be performed with a frequency allowing timely     identification of default. Institutions should ensure that the information about the days past     due and default is up-to-date whenever it’s being used for decision making, internal risk     management, internal or external reporting and the own funds requirements calculation     processes. Where institutions calculate days past due less often than daily, they should     ensure that the date of default is identified as the date when the past due criterion has     actually been fulfilled.	0
22. The classification of the obligor to a defaulted status should not be subject to additional     expert judgement; once the obligor meets the past due criterion all exposures to that obligor     are considered defaulted, unless either of the following conditions is met:	0
23. A technical past due situation should only be considered to have occurred in any of the     following cases:	0
24. Technical past due situations should not be considered as defaults in accordance with Article	0
25. Institutions may apply specific treatment for exposures to central governments, local     authorities and public sector entities where all of the following conditions are met:	0
26. Institutions that decide to apply the specific treatment referred to in paragraph 25 should     apply all of the following:	0
27. Where there are factoring arrangements whereby the ceded receivables are not recognised     on the balance sheet of the factor and the factor is liable directly to the client up to a certain     agreed percentage, the counting of days past due should commence from when the factoring     account is in debit, i.e. from when the advances paid for the receivables exceed the     percentage agreed between the factor and the client. For the purpose of determining items of     the client of a factor that are past due, institutions should apply both of the following:	0
28. Where there are factoring arrangements where the purchased receivables are recognised on     the balance sheet of the factor and the factor has exposures to the debtors of the client, the     counting of days past due should commence when the payment for a single receivable	0
29. Where the institution recognises events related to dilution risk of purchased receivables as     defined in point (53) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, these events should not     be considered as leading to the default of the obligor. Where the amount of receivable has     been reduced as a result of events related to dilution risk such as discounts, deductions,     netting or credit notes issued by the seller the reduced amount of receivable should be     included in the calculation of days past due. Where there is a dispute between the obligor and     the seller and such event is recognised as related to dilution risk the counting of days past due     should be suspended until the dispute is resolved.	0
30. Events recognised as related to dilution risk and hence excluded from the identification of     default should be included in the calculation of own funds requirements or internal capital for     dilution risk. Where institutions recognise significant number of events related to dilution risk,     they should analyse and document the reasons for such events and assess the possible     indications of unlikeliness to pay, in accordance with Articles 178(1) and (3) of Regulation (EU)     No 575/2013 and Section 5 of these guidelines.	0
31. Where the obligor has not been adequately informed about the cession of the receivable by     the factor’s client and the institution has evidence that the payment for the receivable has     been made to the client, the institution should not consider the receivable to be past due.     Where the obligor has been adequately informed about the cession of the receivable but has     nevertheless made the payment to the client, the institution should continue counting the     days past due according to the conditions of the receivable.	0
32. In the specific case of undisclosed factoring arrangements, where the obligors are not     informed about the cession of the receivables but the purchased receivables are recognised     on the balance sheet of the factor, the counting of days past due should commence from the     moment agreed with the client when the payments made by the obligors should be     transferred from the client to the factor.	0
33. Competent authorities should notify the EBA of the levels of the materiality thresholds that     they set in their respective jurisdiction in accordance with point (d) of Article 178(2) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. After the entry into force of the regulatory technical standards     developed in accordance with Article 178(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, where     competent authorities set the relative component of the materiality threshold at a level     different than the 1% referred to in those regulatory technical standards, they should provide     the justification for this different level of the threshold to the EBA.	0
34. Institutions should apply the materiality threshold for past due credit obligations set by their     competent authorities as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No     575/2013. Institutions may identify defaults on the basis of a lower threshold if they can     demonstrate that this lower threshold is a relevant indication of unlikeliness to pay and does     not lead to an excessive number of defaults that return to non-defaulted status shortly after     being recognised as defaulted or decrease of capital requirements. In this case institutions     should record in their databases the information on the trigger of default as an additional     specified indication of unlikeliness to pay.	0
35. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (a) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should consider that an obligor is unlikely to pay     where interest related to credit obligations is no longer recognised in the income statement     of the institution due to the decrease of the credit quality of the obligation.	0
36. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (b) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, all of the following specific credit risk adjustments (SCRA)     should be considered to be a result of a significant perceived decline in the credit quality of a     credit obligation and hence should be treated as an indication of unlikeliness to pay:	0
37. The SCRA that cover the losses for which historical experience, adjusted on the basis of     current observable data, indicate that the loss has occurred but the institution is not yet     aware which individual exposure has suffered these losses (‘incurred but not reported     losses’), should not be considered an indication of unlikeliness to pay of a specific obligor.	0
38. Where the institution treats an exposure as impaired such a situation should be considered an     additional indication of unlikeliness to pay and hence the obligor should be considered     defaulted regardless of whether there are any SCRA assigned to this exposure. Where in     accordance with the applicable accounting framework in the case of incurred but not	0
39. Where the institution treats an exposure as credit-impaired under IFRS 9, i.e. assigns it to     Stage 3 as defined in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, published by the IASB in July 2014, such     exposure should be considered defaulted, except where the exposure has been considered     credit-impaired due to the delay in payment and either or both of the following conditions     are met:	0
40. Where the institution uses both IFRS 9 and another accounting framework it should choose     whether to classify exposures as defaulted in accordance with paragraphs 36 to 38 or in     accordance with paragraph 39. Once this choice is made it should be applied consistently over     time.	0
41. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (c) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should take into account both the character and     materiality of the loss related to the sale of credit obligations, in accordance with the     following paragraphs. Transactions of traditional securitisation with significant risk transfer     and any intragroup sales of credit obligations should be considered sale of credit obligations.	0
42. Institutions should analyse the reasons for the sale of credit obligations and the reasons for     any losses recognised thereby. Where the reasons for the sale of credit obligations were not     related to credit risk, such as where there is the need to increase the liquidity of the     institution or there is a change in business strategy, and the institution does not perceive the     credit quality of those obligations as declined, the economic loss related with the sale of     those obligations should be considered not credit-related. In that case the sale should not be     considered an indication of default even where the loss is material, on condition of the     appropriate, documented justification of the treatment of the sale loss as not credit-related.     Institutions may, in particular, consider the loss on the sale of credit obligations as non-credit     related where the assets subject to the sale are publicly traded assets and measured at fair     value.	0
43. Where, however, the loss on the sale of credit obligations is related to the credit quality of     the obligations themselves, in particular where the institution sells the credit obligations due     to the decrease in their quality, the institution should analyse the materiality of the economic     loss and, where the economic loss is material, this should be considered an indication of     default.	0
44. Institutions should set a threshold for the credit-related economic loss related with the sale of     credit obligations to be considered material, which should be calculated according to the     following formula, and should not be higher than 5%:	0
45. In order to assess the materiality of the overall economic loss related with the sale of credit     obligations, institutions should calculate the economic loss and compare it to the threshold     referred to in paragraph 44. Where the economic loss is higher than this threshold they     should consider the credit obligations defaulted.	0
46. The sale of credit obligations may be performed either before or after the default. In the case     of institutions that use the IRB Approach, regardless of the moment of the sale, if the sale was     related with a material credit-related economic loss, the information about the loss should be     adequately recorded and stored for the purpose of the estimation of risk parameters.	0
47. If the sale of a credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss occurred before the     identification of default on that exposure, the moment of sale should be considered the     moment of default. In the case of a partial sale of the total obligations of an obligor where the     sale is associated to a material credit-related economic loss, all the remaining exposures to     this obligor should be treated as defaulted, unless the exposures are eligible as retail     exposures and the institution applies the default definition at facility level.	0
48. In the case of a sale of a portfolio of exposures the treatment of individual credit obligations     within this portfolio should be determined in accordance with the manner the price for the     portfolio was set. Where the price for the total portfolio was determined by specifying the     discount on particular credit obligations, the materiality of credit-related economic loss     should be assessed individually for each exposure within the portfolio. Where however the     price was set only at the portfolio level, the materiality of credit-related economic loss may be     assessed at the portfolio level and in that case, if the threshold specified in paragraph 44 is	0
49. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a distressed restructuring should be considered to have     occurred when concessions have been extended towards a debtor facing or about to face     difficulties in meeting its financial commitments as specified in paragraphs 163-167 and 172-	0
50. Given that, as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the     obligor should be considered defaulted where the distressed restructuring is likely to result in     a diminished financial obligation, where considering forborne exposures, the obligor should     be classified as defaulted only where the relevant forbearance measures are likely to result in     a diminished financial obligation.	0
51. Institutions should set a threshold for the diminished financial obligation that is considered to     be caused by material forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest, or fees, and which     should be calculated according to the following formula, and should not be higher than 1%:	0
52. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, for each distressed restructuring, institutions should calculate     the diminished financial obligation and compare it with the threshold referred to in paragraph	0
51. Where the diminished financial obligation is higher than this threshold, the exposures     should be considered defaulted.	0
53. If however the diminished financial obligation is below the specified threshold, and in     particular when the net present value of expected cash flows based on the distressed     restructuring arrangement is higher than the net present value of expected cash flows before     the changes in terms and conditions, institutions should assess such exposures for other     possible indications of unlikeliness to pay. Where the institution has reasonable doubts with     regard to the likeliness of repayment in full of the obligation according to the new     arrangement in a timely manner, the obligor should be considered defaulted. The indicators     that may suggest unlikeliness to pay include the following:	0
54. Any concession extended to an obligor already in default, should lead to classify the obligor as     a distressed restructuring. All exposures classified as forborne non-performing in accordance     with Annex V of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 of 16 April 2014 as     amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/227 should be classified as     default and subject to distressed restructuring.	0
55. Where any of the modifications of the schedule of credit obligations referred to in point (e) of     Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is the result of financial difficulties of an     obligor, institutions should also assess whether a distressed restructuring has taken place and     whether an indication of unlikeliness to pay has occurred.	0
56. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (e) and (f) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should clearly specify in their internal policies what     type of arrangement is treated as an order or as a protection similar to bankruptcy, taking     into account all relevant legal frameworks as well as the following typical characteristics of     such protection:	0
57. Institutions should treat all arrangements listed in Annex A to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 5 as     an order or as a protection similar to bankruptcy.	0
58. Institutions should specify in their internal policies and procedures other additional     indications of unlikeliness to pay of an obligor, besides those specified in Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Those additional indications should be specified per type of     exposures, as defined in point (2) of Article 142(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, reflecting     their specificities, and they should be specified for all business lines, legal entities or     geographical locations. The occurrence of an additional indication of unlikeliness to pay     should either result in an automatic reclassification to defaulted exposures or trigger a caseby	0
59. The possible indications of unlikeliness to pay that could be considered by institutions on the     basis of internal information include the following:	0
60. Institutions should also take into account the information available in external databases,     including credit registers, macroeconomic indicators and public information sources, including     press articles and financial analyst’s reports. The indications of unlikeliness to pay that could     be considered by institutions on the basis of external information include the following:	0
61. When specifying the criteria for unlikeliness to pay, institutions should take into consideration     the relations within the groups of connected clients as defined in point 39 of Article 4(1) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In particular institutions should specify in their internal policies     when the default of one obligor within the group of connected clients has a contagious effect     on other entities within this group. Such specifications should be in line with the appropriate     policies for the assignment of exposures to individual obligor to an obligor grade and to     groups of connected clients in accordance with point (d) of Article 172(1) of Regulation (EU)     No 575/2013. Where such criteria have not been specified for a non-standard situation, in the     case of default of an obligor that is part of a group of connected clients, institutions should     assess the potential unlikeliness to pay of all other entities within this group on a case-by-case     basis.	0
62. Where a financial asset was purchased or originated by an institution at a material discount     institutions should assess whether that discount reflects the deteriorated credit quality of the     obligor and whether there are any indications of default in accordance with these guidelines.     The assessment of unlikeliness to pay should refer to the total amount owed by the obligor     regardless of the price that the institution has paid for the asset. This assessment may be     based on the due diligence performed before the purchase of the asset or on the analysis	0
63. Institutions should have adequate policies and procedures to identify credit frauds. Typically     when credit fraud is identified, the exposure is already defaulted on the basis of material     delays in payment. However, if the credit fraud is identified before default has been     recognised this should be treated as an additional indication of unlikeliness to pay.	0
64. Institutions should establish policies regarding the definition of default in order to ensure its     consistent and effective application and in particular they should have clear policies and     procedures on the application of the criteria for unlikeliness to pay as laid down in Article     178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and all other indications of unlikeliness to pay as     specified by the institution, covering all types of exposures as defined in point (2) of Article     142(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, for all business lines, legal entities and geographical     locations.	0
65. With regard to each indication of unlikeliness to pay institutions should define the adequate     methods of their identification, including the sources of information and frequency of     monitoring. The sources of information should include both internal and external sources,     including in particular relevant external databases and registers.	0
66. Institutions that use the IRB Approach and use external data for the purpose of estimation of     risk parameters in accordance with Article 178(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should     apply the requirements specified in this section.	0
67. For the purposes of Article 178(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 institutions should do all of     the following:	0
68. For each difference identified in the definition of default resulting from the assessment of     paragraph 67, institutions should do all of the following:	0
69. Regarding the totality of the differences identified in the definition of default resulting from     the assessment of paragraph 67 and taking into account the adjustments performed in     accordance with point (b) of paragraph 68, institutions should be able to demonstrate to     competent authorities that broad equivalence with the internal definition of default has been     achieved, including, where possible by comparing the default rate in internal data on a     relevant type of exposures with external data.	0
70. Where the assessment of paragraph 67 identifies differences in the definition of default     which the process of paragraph 68 reveals to be non-negligible but not possible to overcome     by adjustments in the external data, institutions are required to adopt an appropriate margin     of conservatism in the estimation of risk parameters as referred to in Article 179(1)(f) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In that case institutions should ensure that this additional     margin of conservatism reflects the materiality of the remaining differences in the definition     of default and their possible impact on all risk parameters.	0
71. For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, except for     situations referred to in paragraph 72, institutions should apply all of the following:	0
72. For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, and where     distressed restructuring according to paragraph 49 of these guidelines applies to a defaulted     exposure, regardless of whether such restructuring was carried out before or after the     identification of default, institutions should consider that no trigger of default continues to     apply to a previously defaulted exposure, where at least 1 year has passed from the latest     between one of the following events:	0
73. Institutions should reclassify the exposure to a non-defaulted status after at least the one     year period referred to in the previous paragraph, where all of the following conditions are     met:	0
74. Where the obligor changes due to an event such as a merger or acquisition of the obligor or     any other similar transaction, the institution should not apply paragraph 73(a). Where the     obligor’s name changes, instead, institutions should apply that paragraph.	0
75. For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, an     institution should define clear criteria and policies regarding when the obligor can be     classified back to non-defaulted status and more in particular, both of the following:	0
76. Institutions should monitor on a regular basis the effectiveness of their policies mentioned in     paragraph 75, and in particular monitor and analyse:	0
77. It is expected that the institution would have a limited number of obligors who default soon     after returning to a non-defaulted status. In the case of extensive number of multiple defaults     the institution should revise its policies with regard to the reclassification of exposures.	0
78. The analysis of the changes in statuses of the obligors or facilities should in particular be     taken into account for the purpose of specifying the periods referred to in paragraphs 71 and	0
72. Institutions may specify longer periods for the exposures that have been classified as     defaulted in the preceding 24 months.	0
79. Institutions should adopt adequate mechanisms and procedures in order to ensure that the     definition of default is implemented and used in a correct manner, and should, in particular,     ensure:	0
81. Where the exchange of client data among different legal entities within an institution, the     parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries is prohibited by consumer protection regulations,	0
82. Further, where the identification of default of an obligor in a manner fully consistent across     the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries is very burdensome, requiring     development of a centralised database of all clients or implementation of other mechanisms     or procedures to verify the status of each client at all entities within the group, institutions     need not apply such mechanisms or procedures if they can demonstrate that the effect of     non-compliance is immaterial because there are no or very limited number of common clients     among the relevant entities within a group and the exposure to these clients is immaterial.	0
83. For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 79, an institution, parent undertaking or any of its     subsidiaries should use the same definition of default for a single type of exposures as defined     in point (2) of Article 142(1) pf Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. They may use different     definitions of default for different types of exposures, including for certain legal entities or for     presence in geographical locations in ways other than via a legal entity, where this is justified     by the application of significantly different internal risk management practices or by different     legal requirements applying in different jurisdictions, in particular by reasons such as:	0
84. For the purposes of point (b)(ii) of paragraph 79, and where different definitions of default     are applied either across types of exposures in accordance with paragraph 83, the     institutions’ internal procedures relating to the definition of default should ensure both of the     following:	0
85. Further, for institutions that use the IRB Approach, the use of different default definitions has     to be adequately reflected in the estimation of risk parameters in the case of ratings systems     which scope of application encompasses different default definitions.	0
86. According to the second sub-paragraph of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, in     the case of retail exposures, institutions may apply the definition of default at the level of an     individual credit facility rather than in relation to the total obligations of a borrower.     Therefore, institutions that use the IRB Approach, in particular, may apply the definition of     default at the level of the individual facility for retail exposures as defined in Article 147(5) of     Regulation (EU) 575/2013. Institutions that use the Standardised Approach, instead may apply     the definition of default at the level of an individual credit facility for all exposures that meet     the criteria specified in Article 123 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, even where some of those     exposures have been assigned to a different exposure class for the purpose of assigning a risk     weight, such as exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property.	0
87. Institutions should choose the level of application of the definition of default between obligor     and facility for all retail exposures in a way that reflects their internal risk management     practices.	0
88. Institutions may apply the definition of default at the level of an obligor for some types of     retail exposures and at the level of a credit facility for others, where this is well justified by     internal risk management practices, for instance due to a different business model of a     subsidiary, and where there is evidence that the number of situations where the same clients     are subject to different definitions of default at different levels of application is kept to a strict     minimum.	0
89. Where institutions decide to use different levels of application of the definition of default for     different types of retail exposures, according to paragraph 88, they should ensure that the     scope of application of each definition of default is clearly specified and that it is used     consistently over time for different types of retail exposures. In the case of institutions that     use the IRB Approach the risk estimates should correctly reflect the definition of default     applied to each type of exposures.	0
90. Where institutions use different levels of application of the default definition with regard to     certain retail portfolios, the treatment of common clients across such portfolios should be     specified in their internal policies and procedures. In particular, where the exposure to which	0
91. The same rule should apply to the obligors treated under the Standardised Approach, where     some exposures to an obligor fulfil the requirements of Article 123 of Regulation (EU)     575/2013 while other exposures to the same obligor are in the form of securities and     therefore do not qualify as retail. Where an exposure in the form of a security fulfils either or     both of the conditions of points (a) or (b) of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, all     exposures to that obligor should be considered defaulted. Where the exposure that fulfils the     requirements of Article 123 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 meets those conditions and the     institution applies the definition of default at the individual credit facility level, the other     exposures to the obligor should not be automatically reclassified to default status.     Institutions, however, may classify those other exposures as defaulted on the basis of other     unlikeliness to pay considerations, as provided further in paragraphs 92 to 94.	0
92. Where, in accordance with the second sub-paragraph of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No     575/2013, the definition of default has been applied at the level of an individual credit facility     with regard to retail exposures, institutions should not consider automatically the different     exposures to the same obligor defaulted at the same time. Nevertheless institutions should     take into account that some indications of default are related with the condition of the     obligor rather than the status of a particular exposure. This refers in particular to the     indications of unlikeliness to pay related with the bankruptcy of the obligor as specified in     points (e) and (f) of Article 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Where such indication of     default occurs, institutions should treat all exposures to the same obligor as defaulted     regardless of the level of application of the definition of default.	0
93. Institutions should consider also other indications of unlikeliness to pay and specify, in line     with their internal policies and procedures, which indications of unlikeliness to pay reflect the     overall situation of an obligor rather than that of the exposure. Where such other indications     of unlikeliness to pay occur, all exposures to the obligor should be considered defaulted     regardless of the level of application of the definition of default.	0
94. Additionally, where a significant part of the exposures to the obligor is in default, institutions     may consider it unlikely that the other obligations of that obligor will be paid in full without     recourse to actions such as realising security and treat them as defaulted as well.	0
95. The application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the obligor level implies     that, where any credit obligation of the obligor meets the conditions of points (a) or (b) or     both of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, then all exposures to that obligor     should be considered defaulted. Institutions that decide to apply the definition of default for     retail exposures at the obligor level should specify detailed rules for the treatment of joint     credit obligations and default contagion between exposures in their internal policies and     procedures.	0
96. Institutions should consider a joint credit obligation as an exposure to two or more obligors     that are equally responsible for the repayment of the credit obligation. This notion does not     extend to a credit obligation of an individual obligor secured by another individual or entity in     the form of a guarantee or other credit protection.	0
97. Where the conditions of points (a) or (b) or both of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No     575/2013 are met with regard to a joint credit obligation of two or more obligors, institutions     should consider all other joint credit obligations of the same set of obligors and all individual     exposures to those obligors as defaulted, unless they can justify that the recognition of     default on individual exposures is not appropriate because at least one of the following     conditions apply:	0
98. The default of a joint credit obligation should not cause the default of other joint credit     obligations of individual obligors with other individuals or entities, which are not involved in     the credit obligation that has initially been defaulted; however, institutions should assess     whether the default of the joint credit obligation at hand constitutes an indication of     unlikeliness to pay with regard to the other joint credit obligations.	0
99. Where the conditions of points (a) or (b) or both of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No     575/2013 are met with regard to the credit obligation of an individual obligor, the contagious     effect of this default should not automatically spread to any joint credit obligations of that     obligor; nevertheless, institutions should assess such joint credit obligations for possible     indications of unlikeliness to pay related with the default of one of the obligors. In any case,	0
100.    Institutions should identify, on the basis of the analysis of relevant legal provisions in a    jurisdiction, and provide in their internal policies and procedures for the identification of the    obligors that are legally fully liable for certain obligations jointly and severally with other    obligors, therefore being fully liable for the entire amount of those obligations, but excluding    credit obligations of an individual obligor secured by another individual or entity in the form    of a guarantee or other credit protection. A typical example would be a married couple    where, based on specific legal provisions applicable in the relevant jurisdiction, division of    marital property (system of separate estates) does not apply. In the case of full mutual    liability for all obligations, default of one of such obligors should be considered an indication    of potential unlikeliness to pay of the other obligor and therefore institutions should assess    whether the individual and joint credit obligations of these obligors should be considered    defaulted. Where one of the joint and several obligors that are legally fully liable for all    obligations, has a joint credit obligation with another client, the institution should assess    whether indications of unlikeliness to pay occur also on the other joint credit obligations with    third parties.	0
101.   Institutions should also analyse the forms of legal entities in relevant jurisdictions and the    extent of liability of the owners, partners, shareholders or managers for the obligations of a    company depending on the legal form of the entity. Where an individual is fully liable for the    obligations of a company, default of that company should result in that individual being    considered defaulted as well. Where such full liability for the obligations of a company does    not exist, owners, partners or significant shareholders of a defaulted company should be    assessed by the institution for possible indications of unlikeliness to pay with regard to their    individual obligations.	0
102.    Additionally, in the specific case of an individual entrepreneur where an individual is fully    liable for both private and commercial obligations with both private and commercial assets    the default of any of the private or commercial obligations should cause all private and    commercial obligations of such individual to be considered as defaulted as well.	0
103.   Where the definition of default is applied at the level of an obligor for retail exposures,    the materiality threshold should also be applied at the level of an obligor. Institutions should    clearly specify in their internal policies and procedures the treatment of joint credit    obligations in the application of the materiality threshold.	0
104.   A joint obligor, i.e. a specific set of individual obligors that have a joint obligation towards    an institution, should be treated as a different obligor from each of the individual obligors. In    the case the delay in payment occurs on a joint credit obligation, the materiality of such delay    should be assessed by applying the materiality threshold referred to in point (d) of Article    178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to all joint credit obligations granted to this specific    set of obligors. For this purpose the individual exposures to obligors participating in a joint	0
105.   When delay in payment occurs on an individual credit obligation, the materiality of such    delay should be assessed by applying the materiality threshold referred to in point (d) of    Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to all individual credit obligations of this    obligor, without taking into account any joint credit obligations of that obligor with other    individuals or entities. Where the materiality threshold calculated in this way is breached, all    individual exposures to this obligor should be considered defaulted.	0
106.   Institutions should have effective processes that allow them to obtain the relevant    information in order to identify defaults in a timely manner, and to channel the relevant    information in the shortest possible time and, where possible, in an automated manner, to    the personnel that is responsible for taking credit decisions, and more in particular:	0
107.   Institutions should verify on a regular basis that all forborne non-performing exposures    are classified as default and subject to distressed restructuring. Institutions should also    analyse on a regular basis the forborne performing exposures in order to determine whether    any of them fulfils the indication of unlikeliness to pay as specified in Article 178(3)(d) of    Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in paragraphs 49 to 55.	0
108.   Control mechanisms should ensure that the relevant information is used in the default    identification process immediately after being obtained. All exposures to a defaulted obligor    or all relevant exposures in case of the application of the definition of default at the facility    level for retail exposures should be marked as defaulted in all relevant IT systems without	0
109.    Institutions should document their policies regarding the definition of default including all    triggers for identification of default and the exit criteria as well as clear identification of the    scope of application of the definition of default and, more in particular they should:	0
110.  For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 109, institutions should document the    application of the definition of default in a detailed manner by including the    operationalization of all indications of default, including the process, sources of information    and responsibilities for the identification of particular indications of default.	0
111.   For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 109, institutions should document the    operationalization of the criteria for reclassification of a defaulted obligor to a non-defaulted    status, including the processes, sources of information and responsibilities assigned to    relevant personnel.	0
112.   For the purposes of paragraphs 110 and 111, the documentation should include    description of all automatic mechanisms and manual processes, and where qualitative    indications of default or criteria for the return to non-defaulted status are applied manually    the description should be sufficiently detailed to facilitate common understanding and    consistent application by all responsible personnel.	0
113.   For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 109, institutions should keep an updated    register of all current and past versions of the default definition at least starting from the date    of application of these guidelines. This register should include at least the following    information:	0
114.   Institutions that use the IRB Approach should adopt adequate mechanisms and    procedures in order to ensure that the definition of default is implemented and used in a    correct manner, and should in particular ensure that:	0
2.1      The business reorganisation plan should demonstrate with a high level of confidence that          its application will restore the long-term viability of the institution or entity referred to in          points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU. Such demonstration should          rely on credible assumptions, a scenario-based analysis and appropriate and concrete          performance indicators capturing the performance of the entire group, the entities and          the business lines that are not to be wound down or sold.	0
2.2      Any assumptions and performance indicators should be compared with appropriate          sector-wide benchmarks and should be in line with available macro-economic forecasts.	0
2.3      Where the business reorganisation plan sets out a description of how the institution or          entity referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU will be          able to provide an acceptable financial return, such return should be assessed by          comparison to relevant peer institutions or entities and historical data.	0
2.4      The risks taken into account by the viability analysis in the business reorganisation plan          should be consistent with institution-specific and broader risks identified by the          competent authority, the central bank or other relevant authority or institution in the          relevant markets.	0
2.5      The worst-case scenario should reflect a significant, albeit plausible, change in the          underlying assumptions in comparison to the base-case scenario. These changes should          focus in particular on the assumptions that are more relevant for the institution under          reorganisation.	0
2.6      Restoration of the long-term viability, even under the worst-case scenario, should not          involve further application of resolution tools beyond the scope of the resolution scheme          under implementation when the business reorganisation plan was drawn up. The          resolution authority should also ensure that the reorganisation of the institution or entity          does not give rise to any material impediments to resolvability. If such material          impediments are identified, the resolution authority should notify the institution or entity          referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU according to          the procedure set out in Article 52(8) of Directive 2014/59/EU and outline relevant          actions for how those impediments could be addressed.	0
2.7      The business reorganisation plan should demonstrate that the institution or entity          referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU is capable of	0
2.8        In order to determine whether the business reorganisation plan is reasonably likely to            restore the long-term viability of the institution or entity referred to in points (b), (c) and	0
3.1        The information provided in the business reorganisation plan and its underlying            assumptions regarding the causes that have triggered the resolution and the            reorganisation strategy should be consistent with the assessment carried out by the            resolution authority and the competent authority and the valuation that informed the            determination of whether the conditions for resolution were met in accordance with            Article 36(4)(a) of Directive 2014/59/EU.	0
3.2        Any analysis of the external operating environment included in the business            reorganisation plan should be consistent with the analysis of opportunities and threats in            the relevant markets, as determined by the resolution authority and competent authority            when carrying out their tasks.	0
3.3        The business reorganisation plan should be feasible and realistic. In particular:	0
       3.3.1    any internal and governance measures should be carried out taking into account                 potential implementation impediments, such as labour law or other contractual                 requirements;	0
       3.3.2    the reorganisation strategy, measures, milestones and performance indicators                 contained in the business reorganisation plan should take into account the                 interdependencies between the legal entities and business lines in the group. These                 might include commercial, funding and operational interdependencies;	0
       3.3.3    the reorganisation strategy, the individual measures, the milestones and the                 performance indicators contained in the business reorganisation plan should take into                 account the situation in the relevant markets;	0
      3.3.4   any divestment of assets, entities or business lines envisaged by the business               reorganisation plan should be tailored to the situation in the relevant markets. The               timing and scope of such divestments should also take into account the interest and               possibility of investors acquiring them;	0
      3.3.5   the benchmark or valuation used to calculate any expected proceeds from divestment               of assets, entities or business lines envisaged by the business reorganisation plan               should be prudent, reliable and realistic.	0
3.4      The reorganisation period should be as short as possible, taking into account:	0
4.1      The business reorganisation plan should be consistent with any business plans that have          been prepared by the institution or entity and submitted to any other authority (e.g.          competition or securities and markets authorities) following regulatory or legal          obligations.	0
4.2      Where the Union State aid framework is applicable, the resolution authority and the          competent authority, when assessing the business reorganisation plan, should cooperate          with the European Commission on the assessment and viability analysis, which is an          objective of both the business reorganisation plan and the restructuring plan.	0
4.3      Where the business reorganisation plan includes measures already featuring in the latest          versions of previously prepared recovery or resolution plans for the institution or entity          referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU, these should          be limited to elements which remain relevant following that institution’s or entity’s failure          and resolution and the situation in the relevant markets.	0
4.4      The reorganisation strategy should not undermine the resolution objectives and principles          laid down in Articles 31 and 34 of Directive 2014/59/EU, as applied by the resolution          authority. The resolution authority and the competent authority should satisfy          themselves that implementation of the reorganisation strategy and measures do not          adversely affect the critical functions of the institution or entity referred to in points (b),	0
5.1      Any milestones and performance indicators contained in the business reorganisation plan          should be sufficiently concrete to enable their monitoring, in accordance with the          reporting obligations referred to in Article 52(10) of Directive 2014/59/EU.	0
5.2      The content of the business reorganisation plan and the progress report should allow the          resolution authority and the competent authority to conclude that the business          reorganisation plan is implemented correctly and will achieve its objectives.	0
5.3      The resolution authority and the competent authority should ensure adequate          arrangements in order to carry out the monitoring, in particular in relation to the timely          flow of information regarding the implementation of the business reorganisation plan.	0
5.4      Where the resolution authority or the competent authority appoints an independent          expert to verify in full or in part the assumptions and the effect of the measures          contemplated by the business reorganisation plan, such independent expert should meet          a standard of independence equivalent to the criteria for independence specified by Part          Five, Title I of the Commission Delegated Regulation [XXX/XXX] supplementing Directive          2014/59/EU (Independence of valuers).	0
1.1      The resolution authority and the competent authority should establish appropriate          working arrangements for the submission, assessment and approval of business          reorganisation plans.	0
1.2      The indicative timeline of the envisaged actions should provide enough time for each          authority to assess the business reorganisation plan after its submission, but also allow          sufficient time for each authority to express any concern, to examine the concerns raised          by the other authority and agree on the appropriate action, taking into account the          deadlines provided in Article 52(7) to (10) of Directive 2014/59/EU.	0
1.3      Both the resolution and the competent authorities should coordinate communication          and, when possible, submit one joint reply to the institution or entity referred to in points	0
1.4      The competent authority should provide its agreement to the approval of the business          reorganisation plan by the resolution authority in writing.	0
1.5      The resolution authority should share with the competent authority all the progress          reports submitted to it by the management body or the person or persons appointed in          accordance with Article 72(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU without undue delay.	0
1.6      Following each submission of the progress report, the resolution and the competent          authorities should establish working arrangements to coordinate and share their          assessment and communication to the progress report. Such arrangements should          provide time for each authority to assess the progress report, but also allow sufficient          time for each authority to express any concerns to the other authority and for the latter          to examine such concerns and agree on the appropriate action.	0
1.7      When a disagreement between the two authorities cannot be resolved within the          timeline established by Article 52(7) of Directive 2014/59/EU, either of the authorities          may refer the issue to the EBA in order for the EBA to assist the authorities to reach an          agreement in accordance with Article 31 of the EBA Regulation.	0
2.1      Where the institutions or entities referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) of          Directive 2014/59/EU under resolution have activities in more than one Member State or          in jurisdictions outside the EU, the relevant resolution authority, before approving the          business reorganisation plan, but within the appropriate timeframe for the assessment,          should:	0
             2.1.1    communicate the business reorganisation plan to the other resolution                       authorities affected by the reorganisation, in accordance with the provisions                       of Article 52(2) of Directive 2014/59/EU, even if they are in jurisdictions                       outside the EU, in accordance with existing cooperation arrangements or with                       existing assessments of confidentiality equivalence;	0
             2.1.2    consider communicating the business reorganisation plan to that institution                       or entity’s resolution college or European resolution college;	0
             2.1.3    provide the resolution authorities referred to in points 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 above                       with the opportunity to comment on the business reorganisation plan and                       take their comments into account, to the extent possible.	0
2.2      Where the institutions or entities referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) of          Directive 2014/59/EU under resolution have activities in more than one Member State or          jurisdictions outside the EU, the relevant competent authority, before communicating its          approval on the business reorganisation plan to the resolution authority, but within the          appropriate timeframe for the assessment, should:	0
             2.2.1    communicate the business reorganisation plan to the other competent                       authorities affected by the reorganisation in accordance with the provisions                       of Article 52(2) of Directive 2014/59/EU, even if they are in jurisdictions                       outside the EU, in accordance with existing cooperation arrangements or with                       existing assessments of confidentiality equivalence;	0
             2.2.2    consider communicating the business reorganisation plan to the other                       members of that institution’s or entity’s college of supervisors;	0
             2.2.3    provide the competent authorities referred to in points 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 above                       with the opportunity to comment on the business reorganisation plan and                       take their comments into account, to the extent possible.	0
2.3      When the bail-in tool is applied to two or more group entities in different Member States,          the relevant resolution authorities and competent authorities should cooperate in the          assessment and approval of the business reorganisation plan.	0
3. When assessing whether there is a material threat to financial stability arising from or    aggravated by the failure or likely failure of the institution under resolution in the context of    the requirement to market the institution relating to the application of the sale of business    tool, resolution authorities should consider the impact on other institutions and financial    markets including infrastructure providers and non-financial institution customers. Resolution    authorities should in particular consider, but not limit themselves to, factual circumstances    that are relevant for the risk that marketing the institution under resolution may result in    aggravating uncertainty and a loss of market confidence. These circumstances should include    at least any of the following:	0
4. Resolution authorities should assess the likelihood of an imminent impairment to any of these    elements which could affect institutions other than the institution under resolution that are    relevant with respect to the financial stability of one or more Member States based on their    relevance as individuals and collectively, as appropriate.	0
5. When assessing whether compliance with the requirements specified in Article 39(1) of    Directive 2014/59/EU would be likely to undermine the effectiveness of the sale of business    tool or achieving the resolution objective of avoiding significant adverse effects on financial    stability, resolution authorities should consider at least the following elements:	0
6. When the resolution authority assesses the need to effect a rapid resolution action in    accordance with point (e) of Directive 2014/59/EU, it should pay particular regard to the    continuance of critical functions, the confidence of depositors and the public, the functioning    of infrastructures and the trading times in relevant markets.	0
17. Credit institutions should comply with these guidelines in a manner that is appropriate to     their size and internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities     and portfolios, and, more generally, all other relevant facts and circumstances of the credit     institution (and the group (if any) to which it belongs). The use of properly designed     proportionate approaches should not jeopardise the high-quality implementation of the ECL     accounting frameworks.	0
18. Credit institutions should also give due consideration to the application of the principle of     materiality. However, this should not result in individual exposures or portfolios being     considered immaterial if, cumulatively, these represent a material exposure to the credit     institution. In addition, materiality should not be assessed only on the basis of the potential     impact on the profit or loss statement at the reporting date. For instance, large portfolio(s) of     lending exposures such as real estate mortgages would generally be considered material even     if they are highly collateralised.	0
19. In considering how to take proportionality or materiality into account in the design of an ECL     methodology or in its implementation, it is important to ensure that bias is not being     introduced.	0
20. The timely recognition of credit deterioration and allowances should not be delayed without     prejudice to the fact that ECL accounting frameworks are symmetrical in the way that     subsequent changes (both deteriorations and reversals of those deteriorations) in the credit     risk profile of a debtor should be considered in the measurement of the allowances.	0
21. Credit institutions should consider a wide range of information when applying ECL accounting     models. Information considered should be relevant to the assessment of credit risk and     measurement of ECL of the particular lending exposure being assessed, and should include     information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic     conditions. Information which is ultimately included in the assessment of credit risk and     measurement of ECL should also be reasonable and supportable. Credit institutions should     use their experienced credit judgement in determining the range of relevant information that	0
     should be considered and in determining whether information is considered to be reasonable      and supportable. Reasonable and supportable information should be based on relevant facts      and sound judgement.	0
22. In order to ensure a timely recognition of credit losses, credit institutions should consider     forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. When considering forwardlooking information, credit institutions should apply sound judgement consistent with     generally accepted methods for economic analysis and forecasting, and supported by a     sufficient set of data.	0
23. Credit institutions should be able to demonstrate how they have considered relevant,     reasonable and supportable information in the ECL assessment and measurement process.     Credit institutions should apply experienced credit judgement in the consideration of future     scenarios and take into account the potential consequence of events occurring or not     occurring, and the resulting impact on the measurement of ECL. Information should not be     excluded from that process simply because an event has a low likelihood of occurring or the     effect of that event on the credit risk or the amount of expected credit losses is uncertain. In     certain circumstances information relevant to the assessment and measurement of credit risk     may not be reasonable and supportable and should therefore be excluded from the ECL     assessment and measurement process. Given that these circumstances would be exceptional     in nature, credit institutions should provide a clearly documented, robust justification.	0
24. The information used shall include an unbiased consideration of relevant factors and their     impact on creditworthiness and cash shortfalls. Relevant factors include those intrinsic to the     bank and its business or derived from external conditions.	0
The management body 21 and senior management of a credit institution are responsible for ensuring that the credit institution has appropriate credit risk management practices, including an effective internal control system, to consistently determine adequate allowances in accordance with the credit institution’s stated policies and procedures, the applicable accounting framework and relevant supervisory guidance.	0
21    Various management body structures can be observed in EU Member States. In some Member States a single-tier structure is common, i.e. supervisory and management functions of the management body are exercised within a single body. In other Member States a two-tier structure is common, with two independent bodies being established, one for the management function and the other for the supervision of the management function.	0
25. The credit institution’s management body should be responsible for approving and regularly     reviewing a credit institution’s credit risk management strategy and the main policies and     processes for identifying, measuring, evaluating, monitoring, reporting and mitigating credit     risk consistent with the approved risk appetite set by the management body. In addition, to     limit the risk that lending exposures pose to depositors and, more generally, financial stability,     a credit institution’s management body should require that senior management adopt and     adhere to sound underwriting practices 22.	0
26. To fulfil these responsibilities, the management body should instruct senior management to:	0
a. develop and maintain appropriate processes, which should be systematic and consistently    applied, to determine appropriate allowances in accordance with the applicable accounting    framework;	0
b. establish and implement an effective internal control system for credit risk assessment and    measurement; report periodically the results of the credit risk assessment and measurement    processes, including estimates of its ECL allowances;	0
c. establish, implement and, as necessary, update suitable policies and procedures to    communicate the credit risk assessment and measurement process internally to all relevant    staff, in particular staff members who are involved in that process.	0
     Senior management should be responsible for implementing the credit risk strategy approved      by the management body and developing the aforementioned policies and processes.	0
27. An effective internal control system for credit risk assessment and measurement should     include:	0
a. measures to comply with applicable laws, regulations, internal policies and procedures;	0
b. measures to provide oversight of the integrity of information used and reasonably ensure that    the allowances reflected in the credit institution’s financial statements and reports submitted    to the competent authority are prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting    framework and relevant supervisory requirements;	0
c. well-defined credit risk assessment and measurement processes that are independent from    (while taking appropriate account of) the lending function, which contain:	0
