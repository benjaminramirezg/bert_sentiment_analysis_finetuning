1.1.   For the purposes of reporting statistical data on fraud in accordance with these Guidelines,        the payment service provider should report for each reporting period:	a.   unauthorised payment transactions made, including as a result of the loss, theft or                  misappropriation of sensitive payment data or a payment instrument, whether                  detectable or not to the payer prior to a payment and whether or not caused by                  gross negligence of the payer or executed in the absence of consent by the payer                  (‘unauthorised payment transactions’); and	1

Since the registering of financial losses borne may be            disassociated time-wise from the actual fraudulent transactions and in order to avoid            revisions of reported data purely due to this immanent time lag, the final fraud losses            should be reported in the period when they are recorded in the payment service            provider’s books. The final fraud loss figures should not take into account refunds by            insurance agencies because they are not related to fraud prevention for the purposes            of PSD2.	1

Executive summary The financial crisis negatively affected the European banking sector and contributed to a build-up of non-performing exposures (NPEs) on many banks’ balance sheets. Although the joint efforts of banks, supervisors, regulators and macroprudential authorities have led to a slow improvement in NPE ratios in recent years, the overall level of NPEs remains high by historic standards, especially in some jurisdictions. In July 2017, the European Council concluded an Action Plan1 to tackle nonperforming loans (NPLs) in Europe. The Council stressed that a comprehensive approach consisting of a mix of complementary policy actions, at national and European level, was needed to address the existing stock of NPLs as well as to prevent the emergence and accumulation of new NPEs on banks’ balance sheets. In this regard, the EBA, along with other bodies and institutions, was invited by the Council to contribute to this Action Plan in four specific areas: (i) supervisory actions to work with banks to improve strategies to reduce NPEs; (ii) measures to improve the functioning of the secondary market; (iii) structural measures to improve the environment for dealing with NPEs; and	(iv) fostering restructuring of the banking system. These guidelines relate to the first area.	1
   18.Furthermore, in line with Article 79 of Directive 2013/36/EU, competent authorities should       ensure, inter alia, that:	    •        credit institutions have internal methodologies in place to assess the credit risk of their              exposures on an individual and on a portfolio basis,	1
    •        credit institutions have internal methodologies in place to assess the credit risk of their              exposures on an individual and on a portfolio basis,	    •        the ongoing administration and monitoring of the various credit risk-bearing portfolios              are operated through effective systems, including the identification and management              of problem credits, as well as the setting aside of adequate value adjustments and              provisions.	1
      13.Furthermore, competent authorities may identify credit institutions other than those          covered in paragraph 11 that should also apply sections 4 and 5. Competent authorities          should require the application of these sections if they identify signs of deteriorating asset          quality. Competent authorities should consider the following elements and their interactions          when assessing the applicability of sections 4 and 5:	       a) increased inflows of NPEs;	1
       a) increased inflows of NPEs;	       b) a high or increased level of FBEs;	1
       b) a high or increased level of FBEs;	       c) a high or increased level of foreclosed assets;	1
       c) a high or increased level of foreclosed assets;	       d) low coverage ratios;	1
       d) low coverage ratios;	       e) breached early warning indicators;	1

   33.Credit institutions should assess and consider the current and likely future external operating       conditions and environment when establishing the NPE strategy and associated NPE       reduction targets. The following list of external factors, where appropriate, should be taken       into account by credit institutions when setting the NPE strategy:	    a) The macroeconomic conditions, including the dynamics of the real estate market or other        relevant sectors, taking into account sector concentrations in NPE portfolios.	1

       d) The maturity of the NPE servicing industry and the availability and coverage of specialised           servicers.	       e) The regulatory, legal and judicial framework. Credit institutions should have a good           understanding of the legal proceedings related to NPE workout for different types of assets           and different jurisdictions. In particular, credit institutions should assess the average           duration of such proceedings, the average financial outcomes, the rankings of different           types of exposures and related implications for outcomes, the influence of the types and           rankings of collateral and guarantees on the outcomes, the impact of consumer protection           issues on legal decisions, and the average total costs associated with legal proceedings.           Legal provisions aimed at protecting consumers, in particular for residential mortgage           exposures, should also be considered by credit institutions when setting the NPE strategy.	1

          successfully operationalise the NPE strategy, credit institutions should consider at least the           following non-mutually exclusive implementation options for different portfolios and under           different conditions:	       a) Hold/forbearance strategy: suitable workout strategy and forbearance options. The hold           strategy option is strongly linked to the credit institution’s operating model, forbearance           and borrower assessment expertise, operational NPE management capabilities,           outsourcing of servicing and write-off policies.	1

       c) Change of type of exposure or collateral, including foreclosure, debt to equity swapping,           debt to asset swapping or collateral substitution.	       d) Legal options: including insolvency proceedings or out-of-court solutions.	1
   43.Credit institutions should establish targets as followings:	    a) by time horizons (short-term (indicative one year), medium-term (indicative three years)        and possibly long-term);	1
    a) by time horizons (short-term (indicative one year), medium-term (indicative three years)        and possibly long-term);	    b) by main portfolios (e.g. retail mortgage, retail consumer, retail, small and medium-sized        enterprises (SMEs), corporate, large corporate, commercial real estate);	1

With regard to retail exposures, these           remuneration policies should be developed in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on           remuneration policies and practices related to the sale and provision of retail banking           products and services.18	1
      56.The NPE strategy should be fully embedded in the risk management framework. In that          context, special attention should be paid to:	       a) ICAAP: 19 all relevant components of the NPE strategy should be fully aligned with and           integrated into the ICAAP. Credit institutions should prepare quantitative and qualitative           assessments of NPE developments under base and stressed conditions including the impact           on capital planning.	1

Credit institutions should prepare quantitative and qualitative           assessments of NPE developments under base and stressed conditions including the impact           on capital planning.	       b) RAF:20 RAF and NPE strategies are closely interlinked. In this regard, there should be clearly           defined RAF metrics and limits, approved by the management body, that are in alignment           with the core elements and targets forming part of the NPE strategy.	1

In this regard, there should be clearly           defined RAF metrics and limits, approved by the management body, that are in alignment           with the core elements and targets forming part of the NPE strategy.	       c) Recovery plan:21 where NPE-related indicator levels and actions form part of the recovery           plan, credit institutions should ensure that they are in alignment with the NPE strategy           targets and operational plan.	1
61.The overarching strategy of a credit institution and its implementation should cover the NPE       strategy and operational plan, which should therefore be set, approved and reviewed by the       management body. In particular, the management body should:	    a) approve annually and regularly review the NPE strategy and operational plan in line with        the overall risk strategy;	1
    a) approve annually and regularly review the NPE strategy and operational plan in line with        the overall risk strategy;	    b) oversee the implementation of the NPE strategy;	1

    c) define quantitative and qualitative management objectives and incentives for NPE workout        activities;	    d) monitor on a quarterly basis progress made in comparison with the targets defined in the        NPE strategy and operational plan;	1
    d) monitor on a quarterly basis progress made in comparison with the targets defined in the        NPE strategy and operational plan;	    e) define adequate approval processes for NPE workout decisions (for large NPEs, these        should involve the approval of the management body);	1
    e) define adequate approval processes for NPE workout decisions (for large NPEs, these        should involve the approval of the management body);	    f)   approve NPE-related policies (including those listed in Annex 4) and processes, review them          at least annually and proceed with any necessary amendments, ensuring that the policies          and processes are completely understood by the staff;	1

    g) ensure sufficient internal controls on NPE management processes, with a special focus on        activities linked to NPE classifications, impairments, write-offs, collateral valuations and the        sustainability of forbearance solutions;	    h) have sufficient knowledge, experience and expertise with regard to the management of        NPEs.	1
      71.Credit institutions should consider the following phases in the NPE life cycle, taking into          account also the specificities of the products and the nature of the arrears:	       a) Early arrears (up to 90 days past due):23 during this phase, the focus should be on initial           engagement with the borrower for early recoveries and on collecting information to enable           a detailed assessment of the borrower’s circumstances (e.g. financial position, status of           loan documentation, status of collateral, level of cooperation, etc.). The type of exposure           and collateral should ultimately determine the most suitable workout strategy, which may           involve forbearance measures with a short-term time horizon, to be applied when           necessary (including during this initial period, where appropriate), with the aim of           stabilising the financial position of the borrower before establishing a suitable workout           strategy. In addition, the credit institution should, where appropriate, seek options to           improve its position while taking into account the rights and interests of consumers (e.g.           by signing new loan documents, perfecting outstanding collateral, minimising cash leakage,           taking additional collateral if available). A dedicated arrears management policy should           contain guidance on the overall NPE workout procedures and responsibilities, including           handover triggers.	1
       a) Early arrears (up to 90 days past due):23 during this phase, the focus should be on initial           engagement with the borrower for early recoveries and on collecting information to enable           a detailed assessment of the borrower’s circumstances (e.g. financial position, status of           loan documentation, status of collateral, level of cooperation, etc.). The type of exposure           and collateral should ultimately determine the most suitable workout strategy, which may           involve forbearance measures with a short-term time horizon, to be applied when           necessary (including during this initial period, where appropriate), with the aim of           stabilising the financial position of the borrower before establishing a suitable workout           strategy. In addition, the credit institution should, where appropriate, seek options to           improve its position while taking into account the rights and interests of consumers (e.g.           by signing new loan documents, perfecting outstanding collateral, minimising cash leakage,           taking additional collateral if available). A dedicated arrears management policy should           contain guidance on the overall NPE workout procedures and responsibilities, including           handover triggers.	       b) Late arrears/forbearance: credit institutions should implement and formalise forbearance           arrangements with borrowers in this phase. Forbearance arrangements should be put into           place only where the credit institution is satisfied that the borrower can afford to make the           repayments. In considering whether a restructuring option is viable, credit institutions           should have regard to Article 28 of Directive 2014/17/EU24 and other legal provisions aimed           at protecting consumers, to the extent applicable. A forbearance arrangement should be           monitored for at least one year in line with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)           No 680/2014, given the increased risk, before it can eventually be transferred out of the           NPE WUs if no further NPE triggers are observed.	1
                                                                                                                      28 FINAL REPORT – GUIDELINES ON MANAGEMENT OF NON-PERFORMING AND FORBORNE EXPOSURES	     c) Liquidation/debt recovery/legal cases/foreclosure: if no viable forbearance solution has         been found due to the borrower’s financial circumstances or cooperation level, credit         institutions should perform a cost–benefit analysis of different liquidation options,         including in-court and out-of-court procedures, having regard also to the interests of the         borrower. Based on this analysis, credit institutions should speedily proceed with the         chosen liquidation option, supported by legal and business liquidation expertise. Credit         institutions that are engaged in extensive use of external experts should ensure that         sufficient internal control mechanisms are in place to ensure an effective and efficient         liquidation process. NPEs that have been categories as such for a long period of time should         be given special attention in this regard. A dedicated debt recovery policy should contain         guidance on liquidation procedures.	1
     85.An adequate technical infrastructure should enable NPE WUs to:	     a) Access all relevant data and documentation, including:	1
     a) Access all relevant data and documentation, including:	              i.    current NPE and early arrears borrower information, including automated                     notifications;	1

   96.The second line of defence controls the implementation of risk management measures by       the NPE WUs and should have a special focus on:	    a) monitoring and measuring of NPE-related risks on a granular and aggregate basis, including        in relation to internal/regulatory capital adequacy;	1
    a) monitoring and measuring of NPE-related risks on a granular and aggregate basis, including        in relation to internal/regulatory capital adequacy;	    b) reviewing the performance of the overall NPE operating model, as well as elements of it        (e.g. NPE WU management/staff, outsourcing/servicing arrangements, NPE reduction        targets and early warning mechanisms);	1

    d) liquidation activities;	    e) other (e.g. NPE-related profit and loss items, foreclosed assets, outsourcing activities).	1
      129. Credit institutions should consider forbearance measures with time horizons not greater          than two years (and, where appropriate, for other forbearance measures) when the          borrower meets the following criteria:	       a) The borrower has experienced an identifiable event that has caused temporary liquidity           constraints. Evidence of such an event should be demonstrated in a formal manner with           clear evidence showing that the borrower’s income will recover fully or mostly in the short           term, or on the basis of the credit institution concluding that a long-term forbearance           solution was not possible due to temporary financial uncertainty of a general or borrowerspecific nature. The form of evidence to be provided for this purpose should be           proportionate to the nature, maturity and value of the credit facility in question.	1
                                                                                                                   39 FINAL REPORT – GUIDELINES ON MANAGEMENT OF NON-PERFORMING AND FORBORNE EXPOSURES	    b) The borrower had been fulfilling contractual obligations prior to the event.	1
    b) The borrower had been fulfilling contractual obligations prior to the event.	    c) The borrower has clearly demonstrated willingness to cooperate with the credit institution.	1
   132. Credit institutions should consider the following factors when assessing the viability of       forbearance measures:	    a) The credit institution can demonstrate (based on objectively verifiable evidence) that the        borrower can afford the forbearance solution, i.e. full repayment is expected.	1
    a) The credit institution can demonstrate (based on objectively verifiable evidence) that the        borrower can afford the forbearance solution, i.e. full repayment is expected.	    b) The resolution of outstanding arrears is fully or mostly addressed and a significant        reduction in the borrower’s balance in the medium to long term is expected.	1
    b) The resolution of outstanding arrears is fully or mostly addressed and a significant        reduction in the borrower’s balance in the medium to long term is expected.	    c) In cases where previous forbearance measures have been granted, including any previous        forbearance measures considered in the long run, the credit institution should ensure that        additional internal controls are implemented to ensure that this subsequent forbearance        treatment meets the viability criteria outlined below. These controls should include, at a        minimum, that such cases are explicitly brought to the attention of the risk control function        ex ante. Furthermore, the explicit approval of the relevant senior decision-making body        should be sought.	1

Furthermore, the explicit approval of the relevant senior decision-making body        should be sought.	    d) Forbearance measures with a short-term time horizon are applied temporarily and the        credit institution is able to demonstrate, based on objectively verifiable evidence, that the        borrower has the ability to repay the original or modified amount on a full principal and        interest basis commencing from the expiry date of the short-term temporary arrangement.	1
    d) Forbearance measures with a short-term time horizon are applied temporarily and the        credit institution is able to demonstrate, based on objectively verifiable evidence, that the        borrower has the ability to repay the original or modified amount on a full principal and        interest basis commencing from the expiry date of the short-term temporary arrangement.	    e) The measure does not result in multiple consecutive forbearance measures having been        granted to the same exposure.	1
   134. Credit institutions should develop a policy on their forbearance activities. The policy should       cover at least:	    a) the process and procedures for granting forbearance measures, including responsibilities        and decision-making;	1
    a) the process and procedures for granting forbearance measures, including responsibilities        and decision-making;	    b) a description of available forbearance measures, including those embedded in contracts;	1

This analysis should be conducted        separately for cured exposures with and without forbearance measures.	    b) Cash collection rate: credit institutions should monitor cash collected from FBEs.	1
    b) Cash collection rate: credit institutions should monitor cash collected from FBEs.	    c) Write-off: where granting a forbearance measure leads to a partial write-off, credit        institutions should record and monitor these exposures against an approved loss budget.        The net present value loss associated with the decision to write off an unrecoverable        exposure should be monitored against the cure rate.	1
   151. The assessment of any financial difficulties on the part of a borrower should be based on       the situation of the borrower only, disregarding collateral or any guarantees provided by       third parties. When assessing the financial difficulties of the borrower, credit institutions, in       accordance with Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, should       consider at least the following rebuttable circumstances:	    a) borrower/facility more than 30 days past due during the three months prior to its        modification or refinancing;	1
    a) borrower/facility more than 30 days past due during the three months prior to its        modification or refinancing;	    b) increase in probability of default (PD) of credit institution’s internal rating class during the        three months prior to its modification or refinancing;	1
    b) increase in probability of default (PD) of credit institution’s internal rating class during the        three months prior to its modification or refinancing;	    c) presence on a watch list during the three months prior to its modification or refinancing.	1
   156. When assessing if FBEs should be classified as non-performing, credit institutions should       assess if exposures:	    a) are supported by inadequate payment plans (either initial or subsequent payment plans,        as applicable) that encompass, inter alia, a repeated failure to comply with the payment        plan, changes to the payment plan to avoid breaches or the payment plan’s resting on        expectations that are not supported by macroeconomic forecasts or by credible        assumptions on the repayment capability or willingness of the borrower;	1

    b) include contract terms that delay the time for the regular repayment instalments on the        transaction, in such a way that its assessment for a proper classification is hindered, such        as when grace periods of more than two years for the repayment of the principal are        granted;	    c) include de-recognised amounts that exceed the accumulated credit risk losses for NPEs        with a similar risk profile.	1
   162. Credit institutions’ policies for identifying performing FBEs should specify practices for       dispelling concerns regarding the borrower’s financial difficulties. Credit institutions’ policies       should require the borrower to have settled, by means of regular payments, an amount equal	                                                                                                     46 FINAL REPORT – GUIDELINES ON MANAGEMENT OF NON-PERFORMING AND FORBORNE EXPOSURES	1
          NPE write-off approaches, credit institutions should pay particular attention to the cohorts           listed below, as they may have higher levels of permanent uncollectability.	       a) Exposures with prolonged arrears: different thresholds may be appropriate for different           portfolios. Credit institutions should assess the recoverability of NPEs if the borrower has           been in arrears for a prolonged period of time. If, following this assessment, it is concluded           that there is no reasonable expectation of recovering an exposure or part of an exposure,           a full or partial write-off should be performed.	1

Credit institutions should assess the recoverability of NPEs if the borrower has           been in arrears for a prolonged period of time. If, following this assessment, it is concluded           that there is no reasonable expectation of recovering an exposure or part of an exposure,           a full or partial write-off should be performed.	       b) Exposures under an insolvency procedure: where the collateralisation of the exposure is           low, legal expenses often absorb a significant portion of the proceeds from the bankruptcy           procedure, and therefore estimated recoveries can be expected to be very low.	1
       b) Exposures under an insolvency procedure: where the collateralisation of the exposure is           low, legal expenses often absorb a significant portion of the proceeds from the bankruptcy           procedure, and therefore estimated recoveries can be expected to be very low.	       c) A partial write-off may be justified when there is evidence that the borrower is unable to           repay the amount of the exposure in full, meaning that there is a reasonable expectation           of recovering a part of the exposure.	1
   183. Credit institutions should develop and implement a robust internal quality assurance policy       and procedures for valuations conducted internally and externally, considering the following:	    a) The quality assurance process should be carried out by a function that is independent from        the function conducting the initial valuation, loan processing, loan monitoring and the        underwriting process.	1
    a) The quality assurance process should be carried out by a function that is independent from        the function conducting the initial valuation, loan processing, loan monitoring and the        underwriting process.	    b) The independence of the external appraiser selection process should be tested on a regular        basis as part of the quality assurance process.	1
    b) The independence of the external appraiser selection process should be tested on a regular        basis as part of the quality assurance process.	    c) An appropriate, similar sample of internal and external valuations should be compared with        market observations on a regular basis.	1
    c) An appropriate, similar sample of internal and external valuations should be compared with        market observations on a regular basis.	    d) Back-testing of both internal and external valuations should be carried out on a regular        basis.	1
    d) Back-testing of both internal and external valuations should be carried out on a regular        basis.	    e) The quality assurance process should be based on an appropriate sample size.	1
   187. Indices used to carry out this indexation may be internal or external as long as they are:	    a) reviewed regularly, with the results of this review being documented and readily available,        and with the review cycle and governance requirements being clearly defined in a policy        document approved by the management body;	1
    a) reviewed regularly, with the results of this review being documented and readily available,        and with the review cycle and governance requirements being clearly defined in a policy        document approved by the management body;	    b) sufficiently granular, with the methodology being adequate and appropriate for the type        of collateral in question;	1
    b) sufficiently granular, with the methodology being adequate and appropriate for the type        of collateral in question;	    c) based on a sufficient time series of observed empirical evidence of actual property        transactions.	1
   193. The credit institution should ensure that each qualified appraiser on the panel:	    a) is professionally competent and has at least the minimum educational level that meets any        national requirements for carrying out such valuations;	1
    a) is professionally competent and has at least the minimum educational level that meets any        national requirements for carrying out such valuations;	    b) has appropriate technical skills and experience to perform the assignment;	1
    b) has appropriate technical skills and experience to perform the assignment;	    c) is familiar with, and able to demonstrate ability to comply with, any laws, regulations and        property valuation standards that apply to the appraiser and the assignment;	1
    c) is familiar with, and able to demonstrate ability to comply with, any laws, regulations and        property valuation standards that apply to the appraiser and the assignment;	    d) has the necessary knowledge of the subject of the valuation, the relevant property market        and the purpose of the valuation.	1
   195. In order to mitigate any conflict of interest sufficiently, credit institutions should ensure       that all internal and external appraisers who are going to carry out the actual appraisal of a       given property and their first-degree relatives meet the following requirements:	    a) They are not involved in the loan processing, loan decision or credit underwriting process.	1
    a) They are not involved in the loan processing, loan decision or credit underwriting process.	    b) They are not guided or influenced by the borrower’s creditworthiness.	1
    b) They are not guided or influenced by the borrower’s creditworthiness.	    c) They do not have an actual or potential, current or prospective conflict of interest regarding        the result of the valuation.	1
    c) They do not have an actual or potential, current or prospective conflict of interest regarding        the result of the valuation.	    d) They do not have an interest in the property.	1

    e) They are not a connected person to either the buyer or the seller of the property.	    f)    They provide an impartial, clear, transparent and objective valuation report.	1
    f)    They provide an impartial, clear, transparent and objective valuation report.	    g) The fee they receive is not linked to the result of the valuation.	1
     210. Calculation of discounted cash flow should take into account cases where:	     a) the operating cash flow of the borrower continues and can be used to repay the financial         debt, and collateral may be exercised to the extent that it does not influence operating         cash flow; and	1
     a) the operating cash flow of the borrower continues and can be used to repay the financial         debt, and collateral may be exercised to the extent that it does not influence operating         cash flow; and	     b) the operating cash flow of the borrower ceases and collateral is exercised.	1
221. In estimating cash flow from property collateral liquidation, credit institutions should use       appropriate and credible assumptions. In addition, credit institutions should pay attention to       the requirements for valuing cash flow under IFRS 13 on fair value measurements. In       particular, financial institutions should comply with the following requirements:	    a) They must determine the assumed time of disposal taking into account current and        expected market conditions as well as the underlying national legal framework regarding        the disposal of mortgaged properties.	1
    a) They must determine the assumed time of disposal taking into account current and        expected market conditions as well as the underlying national legal framework regarding        the disposal of mortgaged properties.	    b) They must ensure that the property price used to determine the estimated market value        of property collateral at the point of liquidation is not based on macroeconomic        projections/assumptions that are more optimistic than the projections produced by the        relevant authorities and organisations such as International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the        European System of Central Banks (ESCB)/ the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), and        therefore does not assume an improvement on the current market conditions.	1
                                                                                                   55 FINAL REPORT – GUIDELINES ON MANAGEMENT OF NON-PERFORMING AND FORBORNE EXPOSURES	    c) They must ensure that income from property collateral is not assumed to increase from the        current levels unless there is an existing contractual arrangement for such an increase.        Moreover, current income from property should be adjusted when calculating cash flow in        order to reflect the expected economic conditions. Credit institutions should consider        whether it is appropriate to project a flat income in a recessionary environment in which        vacant properties are increasing and/or demand for transportation is decreasing, putting        downwards pressure on income.	1

A hold strategy is defined as holding        the asset at above market value assuming that the asset will be sold after the market        recovers.	1
   222. When using the value of collateral in assessing the recoverable amount of the exposure, at       least the following should be documented:	    a) how the value was determined, including the use of appraisals, valuation assumptions and        calculations;	1
    a) how the value was determined, including the use of appraisals, valuation assumptions and        calculations;	    b) the supporting rationale for adjustments to appraised values, if any;	1
    b) the supporting rationale for adjustments to appraised values, if any;	    c) the determination of selling costs, if applicable;	1
    c) the determination of selling costs, if applicable;	    d) the assumed timeline to recover;	1
    d) the assumed timeline to recover;	    e) the expertise and independence of the appraiser.	1
227. Credit institutions should have databases of transactions to enable the proper assessment,       monitoring and control of credit risk, to respond to requests from management and       supervisors, and to enable the provision of information in periodic reports and other timely       and comprehensive documentation. In particular, databases should comply with the       following requirements:	    a) sufficient depth and breadth, in that they cover all the significant risk factors;	1
    a) sufficient depth and breadth, in that they cover all the significant risk factors;	    b) accuracy, integrity, reliability and timeliness of data;	1
    b) accuracy, integrity, reliability and timeliness of data;	    c) consistency – they should be based on common sources of information and uniform        definitions of the concepts used for credit risk control;	1
    c) consistency – they should be based on common sources of information and uniform        definitions of the concepts used for credit risk control;	    d) traceability, such that the source of information can be identified.	1
   230. Foreclosed assets received should be valued at the lower of:	    a) the amount of the financial assets applied, treating the asset foreclosed or received in        payment of debt as collateral;	1
    a) the amount of the financial assets applied, treating the asset foreclosed or received in        payment of debt as collateral;	    b) the fair value of the repossessed asset, less selling costs.	1
   231. When fair value is not obtained by reference to an active market but is based on a valuation       technique (either level 2 or level 3), some adjustments are necessary, in particular as a result       of two factors:                                                                                                    57 FINAL REPORT – GUIDELINES ON MANAGEMENT OF NON-PERFORMING AND FORBORNE EXPOSURES	    a) The condition or location of the assets.

    a) The condition or location of the assets. Risk and uncertainty regarding the asset should be        incorporated in the fair value estimation.	    b) The volume or level of activity of the markets in relation to these assets. The credit        institution’s previous experience of the entity in realisations and of the differences        between amounts arrived at using the valuation technique and the final amounts obtained        in realisations should be incorporated into the calculation. The assumptions made in order        to measure this adjustment may be documented, and should be available to the supervisor        on request. Illiquidity discounts may be considered.	1
235. As part of their ongoing engagement with credit institutions under the SREP, competent       authorities should monitor the application of these guidelines by the credit institutions, in       particular the development and implementation of NPE strategies and related governance       and operational frameworks as described in sections 4 and 5. Competent authorities’       assessments should include, but not be limited to, whether the credit institution’s NPE       strategy:	    a) is embedded into the credit institution’s overall strategy and is subject to appropriate NPE        governance, including a risk management and control framework;	1
    a) is embedded into the credit institution’s overall strategy and is subject to appropriate NPE        governance, including a risk management and control framework;	    b) relies on a credible self-assessment of the credit institution’s internal capabilities;	1
    b) relies on a credible self-assessment of the credit institution’s internal capabilities;	    c) adequately takes into account the credit institution’s operating environment, external        conditions and capital situation;	1

    d) covers not only a short-term time horizon but also a medium- and/or long-term time        horizon;	    e) includes time-bound, realistic yet ambitious quantitative NPE targets and foreclosed assets        targets where appropriate and is supported by an operational plan.	1
      240. Competent authorities should challenge credit institutions’:	       a) Operational plan and organisational arrangements if any of the following criteria is met:	1

Article 3 of the Directive requires Member States to determine a provisional list of at least 10 and no more than 20 of the most representative services linked to a payment account that are subject to a fee and are offered by at least one PSP at national level. When determining their national list, Article 3(2) of the Directive stipulates that: ‘Member States shall have regard to the services that:	            a)       are most commonly used by consumers in relation to their payment account;	1
            a)       are most commonly used by consumers in relation to their payment account;	            b)       generate the highest cost for consumers, both overall as well as per unit.’	1
Considering the next stages set out in Article 3 of the Directive, Member States should bear in mind the following when compiling their provisional list:	    •   the terminology in their provisional list will potentially be subject to harmonisation at the         EU level;	1
    •   the terminology in their provisional list will potentially be subject to harmonisation at the         EU level;	    •   the services listed in the provisional list will be included in each national FID and SoF, and         therefore need to be expressed in a way that consumers will understand;	1
    •   the services listed in the provisional list will be included in each national FID and SoF, and         therefore need to be expressed in a way that consumers will understand;	    •   while information on other services will not be included in the FID, Member States may         require PSPs to provide other information concerning services linked to the payment         account together with the FID.	1
Supporting data and evidence Competent authorities may make use of data from a wide range of sources, provided the data is reliable.These sources might include:	    •   studies carried out by national authorities or other statistics entities that concern consumer         banking and payments;	1
    •   studies carried out by national authorities or other statistics entities that concern consumer         banking and payments;	    •   data already collected by the competent authority concerning fees related to payment         accounts (also on the basis of sample surveys);	1
    •   data already collected by the competent authority concerning fees related to payment         accounts (also on the basis of sample surveys);	    •   reliable data held by consumer or trade associations;	1
    •   reliable data held by consumer or trade associations;	    •   reliable data or research that has been collected by independent research providers; and	1
    •   reliable data or research that has been collected by independent research providers; and	    •   reliable data published or available from PSPs (e.g. fee lists on websites of PSPs).	1
The definition of payment services in the Payment Services Directive allows the identification of a preliminary list of services (although it should be noted that Article 3 of the Directive also covers services other than payment services):	    •   opening or maintenance of a payment accounts;	1
    •   opening or maintenance of a payment accounts;	    •   services enabling cash withdrawals from payment accounts;	1
    •   services enabling cash withdrawals from payment accounts;	    •   issuing and/or maintenance of a payment card or other payment instrument (e.g. annuity on         a debit card or credit card);	1
    •   issuing and/or maintenance of a payment card or other payment instrument (e.g. annuity on         a debit card or credit card);	    •   execution of credit transfers, including standing orders; execution of payment transactions         using a payment card (debit or credit card) or other payment instrument; and	1
    •   execution of credit transfers, including standing orders; execution of payment transactions         using a payment card (debit or credit card) or other payment instrument; and	    •   execution of direct debits.	1
Therefore, in order to identify the most relevant services, the competent authority may rely on three features that assume greater importance, namely:	    a) Commonness	1
This approach may require data to be collected to clarify which services or instruments are most broadly used to ascertain, for example:	    •   What kind of credit transfers are most common?	1
    •   What kind of credit transfers are most common?	    •   What kind of payment cards are used most often– debit cards, credit cards or deferred debit         cards?	1
    •   What kind of payment cards are used most often– debit cards, credit cards or deferred debit         cards?	    •   How many consumers use these different services or instruments and how often?	1
    •   How many consumers use these different services or instruments and how often?	    b) Representativeness	1

1.1. With regard to the criterion of ‘services most commonly used by consumers in relation to      their payment account’ as referred to in point (a) of Article 3(2) of Directive 2014/92/EU, the      factors below should be considered, to the extent deemed necessary to determine the list:	    a. competent authorities should consider the general population of consumers, when assessing        the level of diffusion of services;	1
    a. competent authorities should consider the general population of consumers, when assessing        the level of diffusion of services;	    b. competent authorities should consider the relative prevalence of the services in terms of how        often they constitute a feature of payment accounts;	1
    b. competent authorities should consider the relative prevalence of the services in terms of how        often they constitute a feature of payment accounts;	    c. competent authorities should consider how often the services in question are used, by taking        into account, where possible, the proportion of consumers using the service along with the        number of times the service is used;	1
    c. competent authorities should consider how often the services in question are used, by taking        into account, where possible, the proportion of consumers using the service along with the        number of times the service is used;	    d. competent authorities should include the provision of the account itself as a service.	1
1.2. With regard to the criterion of ‘services that generate the highest cost for consumers, both      overall as well as per unit’ as referred to in point (b) of Article 3(2) of Directive 2014/92/EU, the      factors below should be considered, to the extent deemed necessary to determine the list:	a. when considering fees overall as well as per unit, competent authorities should not only        consider services that fulfil both of those criteria simultaneously, but also services that        generate the highest cost for consumers either overall or per unit;	1
a. when considering fees overall as well as per unit, competent authorities should not only        consider services that fulfil both of those criteria simultaneously, but also services that        generate the highest cost for consumers either overall or per unit;	    b. competent authorities should consider fees cumulatively when determining the unit costs or        overall costs of services that might attract different types of fees;	1
    b. competent authorities should consider fees cumulatively when determining the unit costs or        overall costs of services that might attract different types of fees;	    c. in ascertaining which are the most representative services, competent authorities should        consider the costs that are incurred, or could be incurred, by consumers on an annual basis        for the use of the service, preferably based on the most recent data available covering a 12        month period.	1
3.1. Competent authorities should respond to the Commission and to the EBA using the template in      the Annex. Competent authorities should send the responses to the following dedicated      mailboxes	             EC-PAD-IMPLEMENTATION@ec.europa.eu, and	1

13.Institutions should apply the concept of control as defined in Article 4(1)(37) of Regulation (EU)    No 575/2013 as follows:	       a)    In relation to clients that prepare their consolidated financial statements in conformity              with the national rules transposing Directive 2013/34/EU, 13 institutions should rely on the              control relationship between a parent undertaking and its subsidiaries within the meaning              of Article 22(1) and (2) of Directive 2013/34/EU. For this purpose, institutions should              group clients accordingly on the basis of their clients’ consolidated financial statements.              To this end, references to Directive 2013/34/EU should be understood as references to              the national rules that transposed Directive 2013/34/EU in the Member State where the              institutions’ clients are required to prepare their consolidated financial statements.	1
       a)    In relation to clients that prepare their consolidated financial statements in conformity              with the national rules transposing Directive 2013/34/EU, 13 institutions should rely on the              control relationship between a parent undertaking and its subsidiaries within the meaning              of Article 22(1) and (2) of Directive 2013/34/EU. For this purpose, institutions should              group clients accordingly on the basis of their clients’ consolidated financial statements.              To this end, references to Directive 2013/34/EU should be understood as references to              the national rules that transposed Directive 2013/34/EU in the Member State where the              institutions’ clients are required to prepare their consolidated financial statements.	       b)    In relation to clients that prepare their consolidated financial statements in conformity              with the international accounting standards adopted by the Commission in accordance              with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002, institutions should rely on the control relationship              between a parent undertaking and its subsidiaries within the meaning of those accounting              standards. For this purpose, institutions should group clients accordingly on the basis of              their clients’ consolidated financial statements.	1
       b)    In relation to clients that prepare their consolidated financial statements in conformity              with the international accounting standards adopted by the Commission in accordance              with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002, institutions should rely on the control relationship              between a parent undertaking and its subsidiaries within the meaning of those accounting              standards. For this purpose, institutions should group clients accordingly on the basis of              their clients’ consolidated financial statements.	       c)    In relation to clients to which point (a) or point (b) of this paragraph do not apply (e.g.              natural persons, central governments, and clients that prepare consolidated financial              statements in accordance with the accounting rules of a third country), institutions should	1
            When conducting this assessment, institutions should deem any of the following criteria             to constitute a control relationship:	                i. holding the majority of the shareholders’ or members’ voting rights in another                    entity;	1
                i. holding the majority of the shareholders’ or members’ voting rights in another                    entity;	                ii. right or ability to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the                     administrative, management or supervisory body of another entity;	1
                ii. right or ability to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the                     administrative, management or supervisory body of another entity;	               iii. right or ability to exercise a dominant influence over another entity pursuant to a                     contract, or provisions in memoranda or articles of association.	1
            Other possible indicators of control that institutions should consider in their assessment             include the following:	               iv. power to decide on the strategy or direct the activities of an entity;	1
               iv. power to decide on the strategy or direct the activities of an entity;	                v. power to decide on crucial transactions, such as the transfer of profit or loss;	1
                v. power to decide on crucial transactions, such as the transfer of profit or loss;	               vi. right or ability to coordinate the management of an entity with that of other                    entities in pursuit of a common objective (e.g. where the same natural persons are                    involved in the management or board of two or more entities);	1
               vi. right or ability to coordinate the management of an entity with that of other                    entities in pursuit of a common objective (e.g. where the same natural persons are                    involved in the management or board of two or more entities);	               vii. holding more than 50% of the shares of capital of another entity.	1
18.The provision also makes clear that:	     a) The central government is included in each of the groups of connected clients identified         separately for the natural or legal persons directly controlled by or directly interconnected         with the central government (see scenario CG 2 in the annex).	1
     a) The central government is included in each of the groups of connected clients identified         separately for the natural or legal persons directly controlled by or directly interconnected         with the central government (see scenario CG 2 in the annex).	     b) Each group of connected clients under point (a) includes also persons controlled by or         interconnected with the person who is directly controlled by or directly interconnected with         the central government (see scenario CG 3 in the annex).	1
23.Institutions should consider, in particular, the following situations when assessing economic    dependency:	        a) Where a client has fully or partly guaranteed the exposure of another client and the            exposure is so significant for the guarantor that the guarantor is likely to experience            financial problems if a claim occurs. 15	1
        a) Where a client has fully or partly guaranteed the exposure of another client and the            exposure is so significant for the guarantor that the guarantor is likely to experience            financial problems if a claim occurs. 15	        b) Where a client is liable in accordance with his or her legal status as a member in an entity,            for example a general partner in a limited partnership, and the exposure is so significant            for the client that the client is likely to experience financial problems if a claim against the            entity occurs.	1
        b) Where a client is liable in accordance with his or her legal status as a member in an entity,            for example a general partner in a limited partnership, and the exposure is so significant            for the client that the client is likely to experience financial problems if a claim against the            entity occurs.	        c) Where a significant part of a client’s gross receipts or gross expenditures (on an annual            basis) is derived from transactions with another client (e.g. the owner of a            residential/commercial property the tenant of which pays a significant part of the rent)            that cannot be easily replaced.	1
        c) Where a significant part of a client’s gross receipts or gross expenditures (on an annual            basis) is derived from transactions with another client (e.g. the owner of a            residential/commercial property the tenant of which pays a significant part of the rent)            that cannot be easily replaced.	        d) Where a significant part of a client’s production/output is sold to another client of the            institution, and the production/output cannot be easily sold to other customers.	1
        d) Where a significant part of a client’s production/output is sold to another client of the            institution, and the production/output cannot be easily sold to other customers.	        e) Where the expected source of funds to repay the loans of two or more clients is the same            and none of the clients has another independent source of income from which the loan            may be serviced and fully repaid.	1
                                                                                                                            21 GUIDELINES ON CONNECTED CLIENTS	        f) Other situations where clients are legally or contractually jointly liable for obligations to            the institution (e.g. a debtor and his or her co-borrower, or a debtor and his or her            spouse/partner).	1
        f) Other situations where clients are legally or contractually jointly liable for obligations to            the institution (e.g. a debtor and his or her co-borrower, or a debtor and his or her            spouse/partner).	        g) Where a significant part of the receivables or liabilities of a client is to another client.	1
        g) Where a significant part of the receivables or liabilities of a client is to another client.	        h) Where clients have common owners, shareholders or managers. For example, horizontal            groups where an undertaking is related to one or more other undertakings because they            all have the same shareholder structure without a single controlling shareholder or            because they are managed on a unified basis. This management may be pursuant to a            contract concluded between the undertakings, or to provisions in the memoranda or            articles of association of those undertakings, or if the administrative management or            supervisory bodies of the undertaking and of one or more other undertakings consist for            the major part of the same persons.	1
30.Institutions should also assess any contagion or idiosyncratic risk that could emerge from the    following situations:	         a) use of one funding entity (e.g. the same bank or conduit that cannot be easily replaced);	1
         a) use of one funding entity (e.g. the same bank or conduit that cannot be easily replaced);	         b) use of similar structures;	1
         b) use of similar structures;	         c) reliance on commitments from one source (e.g. guarantees, credit support in structured             transactions or non-committed liquidity facilities), taking into account its solvency,             especially where there are maturity mismatches between the maturity of underlying             assets and the frequency of the refinancing needs.	1
Article 128 of the CRR sets out the requirements for classifying an exposure as an item associated with particularly high risk, which results in an assignment of a 150% risk weight for the considered exposure. Paragraph 2 of Article 128 provides a list of exposures which are assigned to this exposure class:	         (a) investments in venture capital firms;	1
         (a) investments in venture capital firms;	         (b) investments in AIFs as defined in Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 2011/61/EU except where          the mandate of the fund does not allow a leverage higher than that required under          Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC;	1
         (b) investments in AIFs as defined in Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 2011/61/EU except where          the mandate of the fund does not allow a leverage higher than that required under          Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC;	         (c) investments in private equity;	1
         (c) investments in private equity;	         (d) speculative immovable property financing.	1
It should be noted that the Basel II agreement considers all credit exposures carrying a risk weight of 150% or higher to be high risk assets. However, in Article 128, the CRR sets out the notion of ‘items associated with particular high risk’, which serves as a possibility to assign a 150% risk weight where this is not provided by the respective original asset class of a considered exposure. As a result, an exposure that falls under Article 128 CRR is excluded from its original exposure class and is considered instead under ‘items associated with particular high risk’ of Article 128. A high risk exposure (according to the notion provided by the Basel standard) that already receives a 150% risk weight in its original exposure class (e.g. Credit Quality Step 5 or 6 for exposures to corporates) is therefore not affected by Article 128 CRR. The CRR specifies in Article 128(2) four types of exposures that shall be considered as items associated with particularly high risk, namely:	    a) investments in venture capital firms;	1
    a) investments in venture capital firms;	    b) investments in AIFs as defined in Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 2011/61/EU except where the        mandate of the fund does not allow a leverage higher than that required under        Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC;	1
    b) investments in AIFs as defined in Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 2011/61/EU except where the        mandate of the fund does not allow a leverage higher than that required under        Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC;	    c) investments in private equity;	1
    c) investments in private equity;	    d) speculative immovable property financing.	1
This part of the guidelines builds on the criteria already set out in Article 128(3) CRR in which it is required that ‘institutions shall take into account the following risk characteristics, when assessing whether an exposure should be considered of particularly high risk:	                 a. there is a high risk of loss as a result of a default of the obligor2;	1
                 a. there is a high risk of loss as a result of a default of the obligor2;	                 b. it is impossible to assess adequately whether the exposure falls under point (a).	1
1. Institutions should consider that investments in venture capital firms referred to in point (a) of    Article 128(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 include, at a minimum, any investment that    meets both of the following conditions:	    (a) the investment is either of the following types of investment:	1
    (a) the investment is either of the following types of investment:	         (i)        non-debt exposures not listed on an exchange conveying a subordinated, residual                     claim on the assets or income of an enterprise not listed on an exchange;	1
         (i)        non-debt exposures not listed on an exchange conveying a subordinated, residual                     claim on the assets or income of an enterprise not listed on an exchange;	         (ii)       debt exposures and other securities, partnerships, derivatives or other vehicles, the                     economic substance of which is similar to the exposures specified in point (i) and                     not listed on an exchange;	1
         (ii)       debt exposures and other securities, partnerships, derivatives or other vehicles, the                     economic substance of which is similar to the exposures specified in point (i) and                     not listed on an exchange;	(b) the investment is held with the objective of providing funding to newly established         enterprises, including to the development of a new product and related research for the         enterprise in order to bring this product to the market, to the build-up of the production         capacity of the enterprise or to the expansion of the business of the enterprise.	1
2. Institutions should consider that investments in private equity referred to in point (c) of    Article 128(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 include, at a minimum, any investment that    meets both of the following conditions:	    (a) the investment is either of the following types of investment:	1
    (a) the investment is either of the following types of investment:	                (i) all non-debt exposures not listed on an exchange conveying a subordinated,                     residual claim on the assets or income of an enterprise;	1
                (i) all non-debt exposures not listed on an exchange conveying a subordinated,                     residual claim on the assets or income of an enterprise;	                (ii) debt exposures and other securities, partnerships, derivatives or other vehicles, the                      economic substance of which is similar to the exposures specified in point (i) and                      not listed on an exchange;	1
                (ii) debt exposures and other securities, partnerships, derivatives or other vehicles, the                      economic substance of which is similar to the exposures specified in point (i) and                      not listed on an exchange;	    (b) the investment is held with the intention of generating a profit through a leveraged buyout,         an initial public offering, sale of the equity stake by other means or any transaction with a         similar economic substance.	1
5. For the purposes of paragraph 4, institutions should consider, at a minimum, all of the following    exposures as exhibiting levels and ranges of risk drivers that are not common to other obligors    or transactions of the same exposure class:	    (a) any financing of speculative investments in both financial and non-financial assets other          than immovable property, in which the obligor has the intention to resell the assets for          profit, including the financing of speculative investments in mobile property, agricultural          products or intangible assets (such as licenses or patents) where both of the following          conditions are met:	1
    (a) any financing of speculative investments in both financial and non-financial assets other          than immovable property, in which the obligor has the intention to resell the assets for          profit, including the financing of speculative investments in mobile property, agricultural          products or intangible assets (such as licenses or patents) where both of the following          conditions are met:	         (i) there is a particularly high risk of loss in cases of the default of the obligor, in particular              in the case of insufficient market liquidity or high price volatility for the financed object              that has not yet been sufficiently mitigated by contractual arrangements, including              irrevocable pre-sale contracts;	1
         (i) there is a particularly high risk of loss in cases of the default of the obligor, in particular              in the case of insufficient market liquidity or high price volatility for the financed object              that has not yet been sufficiently mitigated by contractual arrangements, including              irrevocable pre-sale contracts;	(ii) there are insufficient other incomes and assets of the obligor available for mitigating               the loss risk for the financing institution, in particular in cases where the loss risk is high               in relation to the financial resources of the obligor;	1
(ii) there are insufficient other incomes and assets of the obligor available for mitigating               the loss risk for the financing institution, in particular in cases where the loss risk is high               in relation to the financial resources of the obligor;	    (b) any exposure for which an issue-specific external credit assessment is not available, which          is to an entity created specifically to finance or operate physical assets other than          immovable property, or is an economically comparable exposure, with contractual          arrangements that give the lender a substantial degree of control over the assets and the          income that they generate and for which the primary source of repayment of the obligation          is the income generated by the assets being financed, rather than the independent capacity          of a broader commercial enterprise, in which any of the following conditions is met:	1
EBA REGULAR USE                                                                                           14 FINAL REPORT ON SPECIFICATION OF TYPES OF EXPOSURES TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH RISK UNDER ARTICLE 128(3) OF REGULATION (EU) NO 575/2013	         (i) the institution has identified in its analysis a high risk of loss resulting from any of the              following:	1
         (i) the institution has identified in its analysis a high risk of loss resulting from any of the              following:	                         significant deficiencies in the financial strength of the corresponding special                           purpose vehicle;	1
                         significant deficiencies in the financial strength of the corresponding special                           purpose vehicle;	                         significant uncertainty related to the political and legal environment of the                           location of the project, if relevant;	1
                         significant uncertainty related to the political and legal environment of the                           location of the project, if relevant;	                         transaction or asset characteristics;	1
                         transaction or asset characteristics;	                         diminished strength of the sponsor or developer;	1
                         diminished strength of the sponsor or developer;	         (ii) the institution has identified a high risk of loss for an exposure related to project finance               in the form of a single project in its pre-operational phase when it does not yet have a               positive cash flow that is sufficient to cover any remaining contractual obligations and               declining long-term debt, and where its cash flows serve both as security and as source               of repayment that the institution considers to be of no high quality, as it renders it               unable to fulfil its financial commitments in a timely manner.	1
6. All equity exposures to a given issuer should be considered whether to be classified as items    associated with particularly high risk where either of the following conditions is met:	   (a) the risk weight for any debt exposure of the institution to the same issuer is 150%;	1
   (a) the risk weight for any debt exposure of the institution to the same issuer is 150%;	   (b) any debt of such an issuer would receive a 150% risk weight if these debt obligations were        exposures of the institution due to either of the following reasons:	1
   (b) any debt of such an issuer would receive a 150% risk weight if these debt obligations were        exposures of the institution due to either of the following reasons:	         (i) the associated credit assessment of an external credit assessment institution (ECAI)              nominated by the institution for the corresponding debt obligation warrants a 150%              risk weight;	1
         (i) the associated credit assessment of an external credit assessment institution (ECAI)              nominated by the institution for the corresponding debt obligation warrants a 150%              risk weight;	         (ii) the issuer is in default in accordance with Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.	1
The guidelines aim to specify the types of exposures to be associated with particularly high risk, by way of:	        providing a clarification on the notions of investments in venture capital and investments          in private equity as referred to in Article 128(2)(a) and (c) of the CRR;	1
EBA REGULAR USE                                                                                       16 FINAL REPORT ON SPECIFICATION OF TYPES OF EXPOSURES TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH RISK UNDER ARTICLE 128(3) OF REGULATION (EU) NO 575/2013	        providing a general approach for identifying exposures to be associated with particularly          high risk;	1
        providing a general approach for identifying exposures to be associated with particularly          high risk;	        specifying examples of types of exposures that should be considered as exposures to be          associated with particularly high risk;	1
        specifying examples of types of exposures that should be considered as exposures to be          associated with particularly high risk;	        introducing a notification scheme for any other high risk exposure assigned a 150% risk          weight by application of Article 128(3) CRR not covered by any other requirement in          these guidelines.	1
In addition, introducing a list of more detailed and objective criteria for the assessment of whether or not single exposures/transactions are subject to a high risk of loss was considered. This would have required institutions to identify additional relevant types of exposure, which are not already covered by Article 128(2) CRR or any part of the guidelines. More detailed and objective criteria such as these would have required institutions to identify exposures that inhibit levels and ranges of risk drivers that are not common to other obligors or transactions in a considered exposure class by taking into account:	    (a) triggers based on the institution’s own credit assessment indicating insufficient financial          resources of an obligor to repay debt;	1
    (a) triggers based on the institution’s own credit assessment indicating insufficient financial          resources of an obligor to repay debt;	    (b) the significance of the amount of exposure, the portion of the unsecured part or level of          loan-to-value (LTV) that would lead to high risk of loss;	1
    (b) the significance of the amount of exposure, the portion of the unsecured part or level of          loan-to-value (LTV) that would lead to high risk of loss;	    (c) internal or external credit rating/quality expressing high level of risk or other aspects, which          would lead to high risk of loss.	1
However, these considerations were discarded for the following reasons:	        If such a list were to be provided it would be deemed necessary to define thresholds for          the individual triggers, otherwise the assignment of an exposure to the high risk exposure          class would be bank specific, which would be in contradiction to the concept of the SA. The          calibration of such thresholds was envisaged to be extremely difficult.	1
        If such a list were to be provided it would be deemed necessary to define thresholds for          the individual triggers, otherwise the assignment of an exposure to the high risk exposure          class would be bank specific, which would be in contradiction to the concept of the SA. The          calibration of such thresholds was envisaged to be extremely difficult.	        It was considered that SA institutions might not have the required information at hand.          Moreover, the proposed triggers would have to be defined with a high level of detail, which          would be difficult, in practice, for SA banks to assess (e.g. LTV with respect to current or          original market value, how to define market value).	1
It has to be noted that the main purpose of the RTS on the materiality threshold for past due exposures is to identify situations where small amounts are past due as a result of technical circumstances rather than the financial situation of the obligor and eliminate them from the estimation of risk parameters. Since the materiality threshold already serves the purpose of identification of technical delays in payments, all other cases, i.e. all exposures where the materiality threshold has been breached, have to be treated as actual defaults. Since the CRR does not envisage any additional exemptions from the days past due criterion the concept of ‘technical past due’ is defined as one of the following situations:	        The identification of default results from a data or system error of the institution, including          manual errors in standardised processes but excluding wrong credit decisions.	1
        The identification of default results from a data or system error of the institution, including          manual errors in standardised processes but excluding wrong credit decisions.	        There is evidence that the identification of default results from failure of the payment          system.	1
        There is evidence that the identification of default results from failure of the payment          system.	        The required payment has been made by the obligor before the relevant days past due          criterion, including the materiality threshold, has been breached but default has been          identified as a result of a long payment allocation process within the institution.	1
        The required payment has been made by the obligor before the relevant days past due          criterion, including the materiality threshold, has been breached but default has been          identified as a result of a long payment allocation process within the institution.	        In the case of factoring arrangements where the purchased receivables are recorded on the          balance sheet of the institution, the materiality threshold has been breached but none of the          receivables to the obligor is past due more than 30 days.	1
In this context it has been specified that all SCRA as specified in Article 1(5)(a) and (b) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 183/2014 on the calculation of specific and general credit risk adjustments, i.e.	(a) losses recognised in the profit or loss account for instruments measured at fair value that             represent credit risk impairment under the applicable accounting framework, and	1
(a) losses recognised in the profit or loss account for instruments measured at fair value that             represent credit risk impairment under the applicable accounting framework, and	(b) losses as a result of current or past events affecting a significant individual exposure or             exposures that are not individually significant which are individually or collectively             assessed, should be considered to be a result of a significant perceived decline in the credit quality of an obligation and hence should be treated as an indication of unlikeliness to pay.	1
It is expected that by the time of implementation of these guidelines many institutions will already apply IRFS 9 instead of current accounting standards. Since these new rules are significantly different from the currently used IAS 39 and introduce the concept of expected credit losses, which is new in the accounting framework, the EBA considers it necessary to specify the treatment of provisions under IFRS 9 – despite those rules not having entered into effect. It is consequently proposed that as a general rule all exposures classified as Stage 3, i.e. exposures treated as credit-impaired under IFRS 9, should be treated as defaulted. Only a few exceptions from that rule have been specified and these include:	        exposures where 180 days past due are used instead of 90 days on the basis of the discretion          provided in Article 178(1)(b) of the CRR;	1
        exposures where 180 days past due are used instead of 90 days on the basis of the discretion          provided in Article 178(1)(b) of the CRR;	        the application of the materiality threshold in accordance with Article 178(2)(d) of the CRR          where it is not used for the purpose of classification of exposures to Stage 3;	1
        the application of the materiality threshold in accordance with Article 178(2)(d) of the CRR          where it is not used for the purpose of classification of exposures to Stage 3;	        technical past due situations;	1
        technical past due situations;	        exposures to central governments, local authorities and public sector entities that are under          specific treatment as described above.	1
2.6 Consistency of the application of the definition of default In order to allow the integration of the definition of default into internal risk management practices it has also been clarified that in some situations institutions may use different definitions of default for certain types of exposures, including in different legal entities or geographical locations. The differences, however, have to be justified and consistent with internal risk management practices and may stem in particular from:	    different materiality thresholds set by competent authorities in their jurisdictions;	1
    different materiality thresholds set by competent authorities in their jurisdictions;	    use of 180 days instead of 90 days past due for certain types of exposures in some         jurisdictions;	1
    use of 180 days instead of 90 days past due for certain types of exposures in some         jurisdictions;	    specification of additional indications of unlikeliness to pay specific for certain types of         exposures.	1
6. These guidelines apply in relation to both of the following:	         (a) the Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRB Approach) in accordance with Part Three,              Title II, Chapter 3 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;	1
         (a) the Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRB Approach) in accordance with Part Three,              Title II, Chapter 3 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;	         (b) the Standardised Approach for credit risk by virtue of the reference to Article 178 in              Article 127 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.	1
11. In order to apply these guidelines for the first time, institutions that use the IRB Approach     should assess and accordingly adjust, where necessary, their rating systems so that the     estimates of risk parameters reflect the new definition of default according to these     guidelines by applying the following:	            (a) where possible, adjust the historical data based on the new definition of default                 according to these guidelines, including in particular as a result of the materiality                 thresholds for past due credit obligations referred to in point (d) of Article 178(2) of                 Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;	1
            (a) where possible, adjust the historical data based on the new definition of default                 according to these guidelines, including in particular as a result of the materiality                 thresholds for past due credit obligations referred to in point (d) of Article 178(2) of                 Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;	            (b) assess the materiality of impact on all risk parameters and own funds requirements of                 the new definition of default according to these guidelines and compared to the                 previous definition, where applicable, after the relevant adjustments in historical                 data;	1
            (b) assess the materiality of impact on all risk parameters and own funds requirements of                 the new definition of default according to these guidelines and compared to the                 previous definition, where applicable, after the relevant adjustments in historical                 data;	            (c) include an additional margin of conservatism in their rating systems in order to                 account for the possible distortions of risk estimates resulting from the inconsistent                 definition of default in the historical data used for modelling purposes.	1
19. Where the repayment of the obligation is the subject of a dispute between the obligor and     the institution, the counting of days past due may be suspended until the dispute is resolved,     where at least one of the following conditions is met:	         (a) the dispute between the obligor and the institution over the existence or amount of              the credit obligation has been introduced to a court or another formal procedure              performed by a dedicated external body that results in a binding ruling in accordance              with the applicable legal framework in the relevant jurisdiction;	1
         (a) the dispute between the obligor and the institution over the existence or amount of              the credit obligation has been introduced to a court or another formal procedure              performed by a dedicated external body that results in a binding ruling in accordance              with the applicable legal framework in the relevant jurisdiction;	         (b) in the specific case of leasing, a formal complaint has been directed to the institution              about the object of the contract and the merit of the complaint has been confirmed              by independent internal audit, internal validation or another comparable              independent auditing unit.	1
22. The classification of the obligor to a defaulted status should not be subject to additional     expert judgement; once the obligor meets the past due criterion all exposures to that obligor     are considered defaulted, unless either of the following conditions is met:	         (a) the exposures are eligible as retail exposures and the institution applies the default              definition at individual credit facility level;	1
         (a) the exposures are eligible as retail exposures and the institution applies the default              definition at individual credit facility level;	         (b) a so called ‘technical past due situation’ is considered to have occurred, in accordance              with paragraph 23.	1
23. A technical past due situation should only be considered to have occurred in any of the     following cases:	         (a) where an institution identifies that the defaulted status was a result of data or system              error of the institution, including manual errors of standardised processes but              excluding wrong credit decisions;	1
         (a) where an institution identifies that the defaulted status was a result of data or system              error of the institution, including manual errors of standardised processes but              excluding wrong credit decisions;	         (b) where an institution identifies that the defaulted status was a result of the nonexecution , defective or late execution of the payment transaction ordered by the              obligor or where there is evidence that the payment was unsuccessful due to the              failure of the payment system;	1
         (b) where an institution identifies that the defaulted status was a result of the nonexecution , defective or late execution of the payment transaction ordered by the              obligor or where there is evidence that the payment was unsuccessful due to the              failure of the payment system;	         (c) where due to the nature of the transaction there is a time lag between the receipt of              the payment by an institution and the allocation of that payment to the relevant              account, so that the payment was made before the 90 days and the crediting in the              client’s account took place after the 90 days past due;	1
         (c) where due to the nature of the transaction there is a time lag between the receipt of              the payment by an institution and the allocation of that payment to the relevant              account, so that the payment was made before the 90 days and the crediting in the              client’s account took place after the 90 days past due;	         (d) in the specific case of factoring arrangements where the purchased receivables are              recorded on the balance sheet of the institution and the materiality threshold set by              the competent authority in accordance with point (d) of Article 178(2) of Regulation              (EU) No 575/2013 is breached but none of the receivables to the obligor is past due              more than 30 days.	1
25. Institutions may apply specific treatment for exposures to central governments, local     authorities and public sector entities where all of the following conditions are met:	         (a) the contract is related to the supply of goods or services, where the administrative              procedures require certain controls related to the execution of the contract before              the payment can be made; this applies in particular to factoring exposures or similar              types of arrangements but does not apply to instruments such as bonds;	1
                                                                                                  23 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	         (b) apart from the delay in payment no other indications of unlikeliness to pay as              specified in accordance with Article 178(1)(a) and 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No              575/2013 and these guidelines apply, the financial situation of the obligor is sound              and there are no reasonable concerns that the obligation might not be paid in full,              including any overdue interest where relevant;	1
         (b) apart from the delay in payment no other indications of unlikeliness to pay as              specified in accordance with Article 178(1)(a) and 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No              575/2013 and these guidelines apply, the financial situation of the obligor is sound              and there are no reasonable concerns that the obligation might not be paid in full,              including any overdue interest where relevant;	         (c) the obligation is past due not longer than 180 days.	1
26. Institutions that decide to apply the specific treatment referred to in paragraph 25 should     apply all of the following:	         (a) these exposures should not be included in the calculation of the materiality threshold              for other exposures to this obligor;	1
         (a) these exposures should not be included in the calculation of the materiality threshold              for other exposures to this obligor;	         (b) they should not be considered as defaults in the sense of Article 178 of Regulation              (EU) No 575/2013;	1
         (b) they should not be considered as defaults in the sense of Article 178 of Regulation              (EU) No 575/2013;	         (c) they should be clearly documented as exposures subject to the specific treatment.	1
27. Where there are factoring arrangements whereby the ceded receivables are not recognised     on the balance sheet of the factor and the factor is liable directly to the client up to a certain     agreed percentage, the counting of days past due should commence from when the factoring     account is in debit, i.e. from when the advances paid for the receivables exceed the     percentage agreed between the factor and the client. For the purpose of determining items of     the client of a factor that are past due, institutions should apply both of the following:	         (a) compare the sum of the amount of the factoring account that is in debit and all other              past due obligations of the client recorded in the balance sheet of the factor, against              the absolute component of the materiality threshold set by the competent authority              in accordance with point (d) of Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;	1
         (a) compare the sum of the amount of the factoring account that is in debit and all other              past due obligations of the client recorded in the balance sheet of the factor, against              the absolute component of the materiality threshold set by the competent authority              in accordance with point (d) of Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;	         (b) compare the relation between the sum described in point (a) and the total amount of              current value of the factoring account, i.e. the value of advances paid for the              receivables and all other on-balance sheet exposures related with the credit              obligations of the client, against the relative component of the materiality threshold              set by the competent authority in accordance with point (d) of Article 178(2) of              Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.	1
36. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (b) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, all of the following specific credit risk adjustments (SCRA)     should be considered to be a result of a significant perceived decline in the credit quality of a     credit obligation and hence should be treated as an indication of unlikeliness to pay:	         (a) losses recognised in the profit or loss account for instruments measured at fair value              that represent credit risk impairment under the applicable accounting framework;	1
         (a) losses recognised in the profit or loss account for instruments measured at fair value              that represent credit risk impairment under the applicable accounting framework;	         (b) losses as a result of current or past events affecting a significant individual exposure              or exposures that are not individually significant which are individually or collectively              assessed.	1
39. Where the institution treats an exposure as credit-impaired under IFRS 9, i.e. assigns it to     Stage 3 as defined in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, published by the IASB in July 2014, such     exposure should be considered defaulted, except where the exposure has been considered     credit-impaired due to the delay in payment and either or both of the following conditions     are met:	         (a) the competent authorities have replaced the 90 days past due with 180 days past due              in accordance with point (b) of Article 178(1) of Regulation EU (No) 575/2013 and this              longer period is not used for the purpose of recognition of credit-impairment;	1
         (a) the competent authorities have replaced the 90 days past due with 180 days past due              in accordance with point (b) of Article 178(1) of Regulation EU (No) 575/2013 and this              longer period is not used for the purpose of recognition of credit-impairment;	         (b) the materiality threshold referred to in Article 178(2)(d) of Regulation (EU) No              575/2013 has not been breached;	1
         (b) the materiality threshold referred to in Article 178(2)(d) of Regulation (EU) No              575/2013 has not been breached;	         (c) the exposure has been recognised as a technical past due situation in accordance with              paragraph 23;	1
         (c) the exposure has been recognised as a technical past due situation in accordance with              paragraph 23;	         (d) the exposure meets the conditions of paragraph 25.	1
                                                                                                   28 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	       breached, all credit obligations within this portfolio should be treated as defaulted at the        moment of the sale.	1
53. If however the diminished financial obligation is below the specified threshold, and in     particular when the net present value of expected cash flows based on the distressed     restructuring arrangement is higher than the net present value of expected cash flows before     the changes in terms and conditions, institutions should assess such exposures for other     possible indications of unlikeliness to pay. Where the institution has reasonable doubts with     regard to the likeliness of repayment in full of the obligation according to the new     arrangement in a timely manner, the obligor should be considered defaulted. The indicators     that may suggest unlikeliness to pay include the following:	         (a) a large lumpsum payment envisaged at the end of the repayment schedule;	1
         (a) a large lumpsum payment envisaged at the end of the repayment schedule;	         (b) irregular repayment schedule where significantly lower payments are envisaged at              the beginning of repayment schedule;	1
         (b) irregular repayment schedule where significantly lower payments are envisaged at              the beginning of repayment schedule;	         (c) significant grace period at the beginning of the repayment schedule;	1
         (c) significant grace period at the beginning of the repayment schedule;	         (d) the exposures to the obligor have been subject to distressed restructuring more than              once.	1
56. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (e) and (f) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should clearly specify in their internal policies what     type of arrangement is treated as an order or as a protection similar to bankruptcy, taking     into account all relevant legal frameworks as well as the following typical characteristics of     such protection:	        (a) the protection scheme encompasses all creditors or all creditors with unsecured             claims;	1
        (a) the protection scheme encompasses all creditors or all creditors with unsecured             claims;	        (b) the terms and conditions of the protection scheme are approved by the court or other             relevant public authority;	1
                                                                                                 30 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	        (c) the terms and conditions of the protection scheme include a temporary suspension of             payments or partial redemption of debt;	1
        (c) the terms and conditions of the protection scheme include a temporary suspension of             payments or partial redemption of debt;	        (d) the measures involve some sort of control over the management of the company and             its assets;	1
        (d) the measures involve some sort of control over the management of the company and             its assets;	        (e) if the protection scheme fails, the company is likely to be liquidated.	1
59. The possible indications of unlikeliness to pay that could be considered by institutions on the     basis of internal information include the following:	        (a) a borrower’s sources of recurring income are no longer available to meet the             payments of instalments;	1
        (a) a borrower’s sources of recurring income are no longer available to meet the             payments of instalments;	        (b) there are justified concerns about a borrower’s future ability to generate stable and             sufficient cash flows;	1
        (b) there are justified concerns about a borrower’s future ability to generate stable and             sufficient cash flows;	        (c) the borrower’s overall leverage level has significantly increased or there are justified             expectations of such changes to leverage;	1
        (c) the borrower’s overall leverage level has significantly increased or there are justified             expectations of such changes to leverage;	        (d) the borrower has breached the covenants of a credit contract;	1
        (d) the borrower has breached the covenants of a credit contract;	        (e) the institution has called any collateral including a guarantee;	1
        (e) the institution has called any collateral including a guarantee;	        (f) for the exposures to an individual: default of a company fully owned by a single             individual where this individual provided the institution with a personal guarantee for             all obligations of a company;	1
                                                                                                             31 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	        (g) for retail exposures where the default definition is applied at the level of an individual             credit facility, the fact that a significant part of the total obligation of the obligor is in             default;	1
        (g) for retail exposures where the default definition is applied at the level of an individual             credit facility, the fact that a significant part of the total obligation of the obligor is in             default;	        (h) the reporting of an exposure as non-performing in accordance with Annex V of             Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 of 16 April 2014 as amended             by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/227, except where competent             authorities have replaced the 90 days past due with 180 days past due in accordance             with point (b) of Article 178(1) of Regulation EU (No) 575/2013.	1
60. Institutions should also take into account the information available in external databases,     including credit registers, macroeconomic indicators and public information sources, including     press articles and financial analyst’s reports. The indications of unlikeliness to pay that could     be considered by institutions on the basis of external information include the following:	        (a) significant delays in payments to other creditors have been recorded in the relevant             credit register;	1
        (a) significant delays in payments to other creditors have been recorded in the relevant             credit register;	        (b) a crisis of the sector in which the counterparty operates combined with a weak             position of the counterparty in this sector;	1
        (b) a crisis of the sector in which the counterparty operates combined with a weak             position of the counterparty in this sector;	        (c) disappearance of an active market for a financial asset because of the financial             difficulties of the debtor;	1
        (c) disappearance of an active market for a financial asset because of the financial             difficulties of the debtor;	        (d) an institution has information that a third party, in particular another institution, has             filed for bankruptcy or similar protection of the obligor.	1
67. For the purposes of Article 178(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 institutions should do all of     the following:	         (a) verify whether the definition of default used in the external data is in line with Article	1
         (a) verify whether the definition of default used in the external data is in line with Article	178 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013;	1
              and level of specific credit risk adjustments that triggers default and the criteria to               return to non-defaulted status;	         (c) document sources of external data, the default definition used in external data, the              performed analysis and all identified differences.	1
68. For each difference identified in the definition of default resulting from the assessment of     paragraph 67, institutions should do all of the following:	         (a) assess whether the adjustment to the internal definition of default would lead to an              increased or a decreased default rate or whether it is impossible to determine;	1
         (a) assess whether the adjustment to the internal definition of default would lead to an              increased or a decreased default rate or whether it is impossible to determine;	         (b) either perform appropriate adjustments in the external data or be able to              demonstrate that the difference is negligible in terms of the impact on all risk              parameters and own funds requirements,	1
71. For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, except for     situations referred to in paragraph 72, institutions should apply all of the following:	         (a) consider that no trigger of default continues to apply to a previously defaulted              exposure, where at least 3 months have passed since the moment that the conditions	1
              referred to in Articles 178(1)(b) and 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 cease to               be met;	         (b) take into account the behaviour of the obligor during the period referred to in point	1
         (b) take into account the behaviour of the obligor during the period referred to in point	(a);	1
         (c) take into account the financial situation of the obligor during the period referred to in              point (a);	         (d) after the period referred to in point (a), perform an assessment, and, where the              institution still finds that the obligor is unlikely to pay its obligations in full without              recourse to realising security, the exposures should continue to be classified as              defaulted until the institution is satisfied that the improvement of the credit quality is              factual and permanent;	1
         (d) after the period referred to in point (a), perform an assessment, and, where the              institution still finds that the obligor is unlikely to pay its obligations in full without              recourse to realising security, the exposures should continue to be classified as              defaulted until the institution is satisfied that the improvement of the credit quality is              factual and permanent;	         (e) the conditions referred to in points (a) to (d) should be met also with regard to new              exposures to the obligor, in particular where the previous defaulted exposures to this              obligor were sold or written off.	1
72. For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, and where     distressed restructuring according to paragraph 49 of these guidelines applies to a defaulted     exposure, regardless of whether such restructuring was carried out before or after the     identification of default, institutions should consider that no trigger of default continues to     apply to a previously defaulted exposure, where at least 1 year has passed from the latest     between one of the following events:	         (a) the moment of extending the restructuring measures;	1
         (a) the moment of extending the restructuring measures;	         (b) the moment when the exposure has been classified as defaulted;	1
         (b) the moment when the exposure has been classified as defaulted;	         (c) the end of the grace period included in the restructuring arrangements.	1
73. Institutions should reclassify the exposure to a non-defaulted status after at least the one     year period referred to in the previous paragraph, where all of the following conditions are     met:	        (a) during that period a material payment has been made by the obligor; material             payment may be considered to be made where the debtor has paid, via its regular             payments in accordance with the restructuring arrangements, a total equal to the             amount that was previously past-due (if there were past-due amounts) or that has             been written-off (if there were no past-due amounts) under the restructuring             measures;	1
                                                                                                     35 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	        (b) during that period the payments have been made regularly according to the schedule             applicable after the restructuring arrangements;	1
        (b) during that period the payments have been made regularly according to the schedule             applicable after the restructuring arrangements;	        (c) there are no past due credit obligations according to the schedule applicable after the             restructuring arrangements;	1
        (c) there are no past due credit obligations according to the schedule applicable after the             restructuring arrangements;	        (d) no indications of unlikeliness to pay as specified in Article 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No             575/2013 or any additional indications of unlikeliness to pay specified by the             institution apply;	1
        (d) no indications of unlikeliness to pay as specified in Article 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No             575/2013 or any additional indications of unlikeliness to pay specified by the             institution apply;	        (e) the institution does not consider it otherwise unlikely that the obligor will pay its credit             obligations in full according to the schedule after the restructuring arrangements             without recourse to realising security. In this assessment institutions should examine             in particular situations where a large lumpsum payment or significantly larger             payments are envisaged at the end of the repayment schedule;	1
        (e) the institution does not consider it otherwise unlikely that the obligor will pay its credit             obligations in full according to the schedule after the restructuring arrangements             without recourse to realising security. In this assessment institutions should examine             in particular situations where a large lumpsum payment or significantly larger             payments are envisaged at the end of the repayment schedule;	        (f) the conditions referred to in points (a) to (e) should be met also with regard to new             exposures to the obligor, in particular where the previous defaulted exposures to this             obligor that were subject to distressed restructuring were sold or written off.	1
75. For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, an     institution should define clear criteria and policies regarding when the obligor can be     classified back to non-defaulted status and more in particular, both of the following:	         (a) when it can be considered that the improvement of the financial situation of an              obligor is sufficient to allow the full and timely repayment of the credit obligation;	1
         (a) when it can be considered that the improvement of the financial situation of an              obligor is sufficient to allow the full and timely repayment of the credit obligation;	         (b) when the repayment is actually likely to be made even where there is an              improvement in the financial situation of an obligor in accordance with point (a).	1
76. Institutions should monitor on a regular basis the effectiveness of their policies mentioned in     paragraph 75, and in particular monitor and analyse:	         (a) the changes of status of the obligors or facilities;	1
         (a) the changes of status of the obligors or facilities;	         (b) the impact of the adopted policies on cure rates;	1
         (b) the impact of the adopted policies on cure rates;	         (c) the impact of adopted policies on multiple defaults.	1
79. Institutions should adopt adequate mechanisms and procedures in order to ensure that the     definition of default is implemented and used in a correct manner, and should, in particular,     ensure:	         (a) that default of a single obligor is identified consistently across the institution with              regard to all exposures to this obligor in all relevant IT systems, including in all the              legal entities within the group and in all geographical locations in accordance with              paragraphs 80 to 82 or for retail exposures in accordance with paragraphs 92 to 94;	1
         (a) that default of a single obligor is identified consistently across the institution with              regard to all exposures to this obligor in all relevant IT systems, including in all the              legal entities within the group and in all geographical locations in accordance with              paragraphs 80 to 82 or for retail exposures in accordance with paragraphs 92 to 94;	         (b) that one of the following applies:	1
         (b) that one of the following applies:	                    i. the same definition of default is used consistently by an institution, parent                        undertaking or any of its subsidiaries and across the types of exposures;	1
                    i. the same definition of default is used consistently by an institution, parent                        undertaking or any of its subsidiaries and across the types of exposures;	                   ii. where different definitions of default apply either within a group or across                        the types of exposures, the scope of application of each of the default                        definitions is clearly specified, in accordance with paragraphs 83 to 85;	1
83. For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 79, an institution, parent undertaking or any of its     subsidiaries should use the same definition of default for a single type of exposures as defined     in point (2) of Article 142(1) pf Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. They may use different     definitions of default for different types of exposures, including for certain legal entities or for     presence in geographical locations in ways other than via a legal entity, where this is justified     by the application of significantly different internal risk management practices or by different     legal requirements applying in different jurisdictions, in particular by reasons such as:	         (a) different materiality thresholds set by competent authorities in their jurisdictions in              accordance with point (d) of Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;	1
         (a) different materiality thresholds set by competent authorities in their jurisdictions in              accordance with point (d) of Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;	         (b) the use of 180 days instead of 90 days past due for certain types of exposures to              which the IRB Approach is applied in some jurisdictions in accordance with point (b)              of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;	1
         (b) the use of 180 days instead of 90 days past due for certain types of exposures to              which the IRB Approach is applied in some jurisdictions in accordance with point (b)              of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;	         (c) the specification of additional indications of unlikeliness to pay specific for certain              legal entities, geographical locations or types of exposures.	1
84. For the purposes of point (b)(ii) of paragraph 79, and where different definitions of default     are applied either across types of exposures in accordance with paragraph 83, the     institutions’ internal procedures relating to the definition of default should ensure both of the     following:	         (a) that the scope of application of each definition is clearly specified;	1
         (a) that the scope of application of each definition is clearly specified;	         (b) that the definition of default specified for a certain type of exposures, legal entity or              geographical location is applied consistently to all exposures within the scope of              application of each relevant definition of default.	1
97. Where the conditions of points (a) or (b) or both of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No     575/2013 are met with regard to a joint credit obligation of two or more obligors, institutions     should consider all other joint credit obligations of the same set of obligors and all individual     exposures to those obligors as defaulted, unless they can justify that the recognition of     default on individual exposures is not appropriate because at least one of the following     conditions apply:	         (a) the delay in payment of a joint credit obligation results from a dispute between the              individual obligors participating in the joint credit obligation that has been introduced              to a court or another formal procedure performed by a dedicated external body that              results in a binding ruling in accordance with the applicable legal framework in the              relevant jurisdiction, and there is no concern about the financial situation of the              individual obligors;	1
         (a) the delay in payment of a joint credit obligation results from a dispute between the              individual obligors participating in the joint credit obligation that has been introduced              to a court or another formal procedure performed by a dedicated external body that              results in a binding ruling in accordance with the applicable legal framework in the              relevant jurisdiction, and there is no concern about the financial situation of the              individual obligors;	         (b) a joint credit obligation is an immaterial part of the total obligations of an individual              obligor.	1
106.   Institutions should have effective processes that allow them to obtain the relevant    information in order to identify defaults in a timely manner, and to channel the relevant    information in the shortest possible time and, where possible, in an automated manner, to    the personnel that is responsible for taking credit decisions, and more in particular:	         (a) where they apply automatic processes, such as counting of days past due, the              identification of indications of default should be performed on a daily basis;	1
         (a) where they apply automatic processes, such as counting of days past due, the              identification of indications of default should be performed on a daily basis;	         (b) where they implement manual processes, such as checking external sources and              databases, analysis of watch lists, analysis of the lists of forborne exposures,              identification of SCRA, the information should be updated with a frequency that              guarantees the timely identification of default.	1
109.    Institutions should document their policies regarding the definition of default including all    triggers for identification of default and the exit criteria as well as clear identification of the    scope of application of the definition of default and, more in particular they should:	         (a) document the operationalisation of all indications of default;	1
         (a) document the operationalisation of all indications of default;	         (b) document the operationalisation of the criteria for reclassification of a defaulted              obligor to a non-defaulted status;	1
         (b) document the operationalisation of the criteria for reclassification of a defaulted              obligor to a non-defaulted status;	         (c) keep an updated register of all definitions of default.	1
113.   For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 109, institutions should keep an updated    register of all current and past versions of the default definition at least starting from the date    of application of these guidelines. This register should include at least the following    information:	         (a) the scope of application of the default definition, if there is more than one default              definition used within the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its              subsidiaries;	1
                                                                                                   44 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	         (b) the body approving the definition or definitions of default and date of approval for              each of those definitions of default;	1
         (b) the body approving the definition or definitions of default and date of approval for              each of those definitions of default;	         (c) the date of implementation of each definition of default;	1
         (c) the date of implementation of each definition of default;	         (d) brief description of all changes performed relatively to the last version;	1
         (d) brief description of all changes performed relatively to the last version;	         (e) in the case of institutions that have permission to use the IRB Approach, the change              category assigned, the date of submission to the competent authorities and, if              applicable, the date of approval by the competent authorities.	1
114.   Institutions that use the IRB Approach should adopt adequate mechanisms and    procedures in order to ensure that the definition of default is implemented and used in a    correct manner, and should in particular ensure that:	         (a) the definition of default and the scope of its application is what is required to be              approved by the management body, or by a committee designated by it, and by              senior management in accordance with Article 189(1) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013;	1
         (a) the definition of default and the scope of its application is what is required to be              approved by the management body, or by a committee designated by it, and by              senior management in accordance with Article 189(1) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013;	         (b) the definition of default is used consistently for the purpose of the own funds              requirements calculation and plays a meaningful role in the internal risk management              processes by being used at least in the area of monitoring of exposures and in the              internal reporting to senior management and management body;	1
         (b) the definition of default is used consistently for the purpose of the own funds              requirements calculation and plays a meaningful role in the internal risk management              processes by being used at least in the area of monitoring of exposures and in the              internal reporting to senior management and management body;	         (c) the internal audit unit or another comparable independent auditing unit reviews              regularly the robustness and effectiveness of the process used by the institution for              the identification of default, taking into account in particular the timeliness of the              identification of default referred to in paragraphs 106 to 108; and ensuring that the              conclusions of the internal audit’s review and respective recommendations, as well as              the measures taken to remedy the identified weaknesses are communicated directly              to the management body or the committee designated by it.	1
The GL aim to set common criteria in the major policy fields, including:	    past due criterion as an indication of default;	1
    past due criterion as an indication of default;	    indications of unlikeliness to pay;	1
    indications of unlikeliness to pay;	    return to non-defaulted status;	1
    return to non-defaulted status;	    the application of the definition of default for retail exposures;	1
    the application of the definition of default for retail exposures;	    the application of the definition of default in external data.	1
The GL require that if an institution decides to use different levels of application of the definition of default for different types of retail exposures the scope of application of each definition of default should be clearly specified. In addition to this, the GL considered:	a. a requirement to use the same level of application across all retail portfolios of the        institution, parent undertaking and any of its subsidiaries;	1
a. a requirement to use the same level of application across all retail portfolios of the        institution, parent undertaking and any of its subsidiaries;	b. the possibility of using different levels of application of the definition of default for certain        retail portfolios only where there are no or a limited number of common clients between        those portfolios (i.e. the number of common clients is kept to a strict minimum); and	1
                                                                                                     49 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	    c. the possibility of using different levels of application of the definition of default for certain        retail portfolios if this is justified by different internal risk management practices.	1
                                                                                                      50 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	    a. no pulling effect for prudential purposes;	1
    a. no pulling effect for prudential purposes;	b. the threshold for the pulling effect to be specified by the institution;	1
b. the threshold for the pulling effect to be specified by the institution;	c. the threshold for the pulling effect to be specified by the institution with a cap at 20%;	1
c. the threshold for the pulling effect to be specified by the institution with a cap at 20%;	d. the threshold for the pulling effect to be specified at the level of 20%.	1
The qualitative analysis assessed whether the GL should introduce a precise definition of ‘technical past due situation’ or ‘technical default’ in order to ensure harmonised application of the definition of default. The assessment included the following options:	a. no definition of technical default;	1
a. no definition of technical default;	b. technical default referring to various non-credit-related reasons for delays in payments;	1
b. technical default referring to various non-credit-related reasons for delays in payments;	c. technical default specified as a situation where the default event has not really occurred,        as default identification was a result of certain errors or inefficiencies in data, IT systems        or processes;	1
c. technical default specified as a situation where the default event has not really occurred,        as default identification was a result of certain errors or inefficiencies in data, IT systems        or processes;	d. technical default specified as in option c but with an additional clarification for factoring        arrangements where the purchased receivables are recorded on the balance sheet of the        institution; in this case, technical default would be specified as a situation where the        materiality threshold is breached but none of the receivables is past due more than 30        days;	1
d. technical default specified as in option c but with an additional clarification for factoring        arrangements where the purchased receivables are recorded on the balance sheet of the        institution; in this case, technical default would be specified as a situation where the        materiality threshold is breached but none of the receivables is past due more than 30        days;	e. technical default specified as a situation where an exposure is past due and the        materiality threshold has not been breached.	1
Exposures to central governments, local authorities and public sector entities are often characterised by lengthy administrative procedures related to repayment processes, which may lead to these counterparties meeting their financial obligations with delay. As many respondents in the consultation process requested a specific treatment for these exposures considering the non-credit-risk nature of such delays in payment, this was taken into account in the specification of the final GL. The following options were considered:	a. the possibility of classifying these exposures as technical past due situations with                  full flexibility to apply expert judgement in assessing whether the delay in                  payment results from technical or credit-related reasons;	1
a. the possibility of classifying these exposures as technical past due situations with                  full flexibility to apply expert judgement in assessing whether the delay in                  payment results from technical or credit-related reasons;	b. the possibility of classifying these exposures as technical past due situations                  under specific, objective conditions;	1
b. the possibility of classifying these exposures as technical past due situations                  under specific, objective conditions;	c. including in the GL a specific treatment for these exposures, including criteria for                  the scope of application of this specific treatment and monitoring requirements;	1
c. including in the GL a specific treatment for these exposures, including criteria for                  the scope of application of this specific treatment and monitoring requirements;	d. applying the same general treatment as for all other exposures.	1
                                                                                                  53 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	judgement would not grant sufficient objectivity in recognising a technical past due situation and as a result the comparability of the definition of default for these types of obligors would be compromised.	1
The supervisory reporting framework and in particular the ITS on non-performing exposures and forbearance defines these concepts, which are related to the quality of assets and obligors. As the industry has requested on several occasions that supervisory reporting be aligned with the prudential framework this was taken into consideration in the specification of these GL. The following main options were considered:	a. alignment of the definition of default with non-performing exposures;	1
a. alignment of the definition of default with non-performing exposures;	b. alignment of the definition of default with non-performing exposures with the exception        of the use of 180 days past due instead of 90;	1
b. alignment of the definition of default with non-performing exposures with the exception        of the use of 180 days past due instead of 90;	c. non-obligatory alignment of the definition of default with non-performing exposures;	1
c. non-obligatory alignment of the definition of default with non-performing exposures;	d. no alignment – non-performing exposures remain a broader category than defaulted        exposures.	1
The following main options were considered:	a. both Stage 2 and Stage 3 exposures should be automatically classified as defaulted;	1
a. both Stage 2 and Stage 3 exposures should be automatically classified as defaulted;	b. all Stage 3 exposures and some Stage 2 exposures, under certain conditions, should be        classified as defaulted;	1
b. all Stage 3 exposures and some Stage 2 exposures, under certain conditions, should be        classified as defaulted;	c. Stage 3 exposures under IFRS 9 should be automatically classified as defaulted;	1
c. Stage 3 exposures under IFRS 9 should be automatically classified as defaulted;	d. Stage 3 exposures under IFRS 9 should be classified as defaulted with some exceptions.	1
Where an institution sells credit obligations due to a decrease in their credit quality or the loss on that sale is otherwise related to the credit quality of the obligations, the institution should analyse the materiality of the economic loss. If the economic loss is material this should be considered an indication of default. The assessment looked at the following options:	a. no threshold for the materiality of the economic loss related to the sale of credit         obligations – any credit-related loss leads to default;	1
a. no threshold for the materiality of the economic loss related to the sale of credit         obligations – any credit-related loss leads to default;	b. threshold for the materiality of the economic loss defined as the difference between the         outstanding amounts of the obligations and the agreed sale price;	1
                                                                                                    56 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	     c. threshold for the materiality of the economic loss defined as the difference between the         outstanding amounts of the obligations and the agreed sale price, subject to a cap;	1
     c. threshold for the materiality of the economic loss defined as the difference between the         outstanding amounts of the obligations and the agreed sale price, subject to a cap;	d. threshold for the materiality of the economic loss defined by the institutions.	1
The policy options relate to if the GL should introduce a threshold for distressed restructuring for the scale at which the financial obligation is diminished and if they do then in what form this threshold should be specified. In this regard, the following options have been considered:	a. no threshold for the diminished financial obligation;	1
a. no threshold for the diminished financial obligation;	b. threshold for the diminished financial obligation specified by institutions as the difference        between the present value of expected cash flows before and after changes in the terms        and conditions of the contract;	1
b. threshold for the diminished financial obligation specified by institutions as the difference        between the present value of expected cash flows before and after changes in the terms        and conditions of the contract;	c. threshold for the diminished financial obligation specified by institutions as the difference        between the present value of expected cash flows before and after changes in the terms        and conditions of the contract, subject to a cap;	1
c. threshold for the diminished financial obligation specified by institutions as the difference        between the present value of expected cash flows before and after changes in the terms        and conditions of the contract, subject to a cap;	d. threshold for the diminished financial obligation to be specified by institutions.	1

The assessment of possible policy options is similar to the previous analysis and looks at the probation period together with other conditions for when exposures under distressed restructuring may return to non-defaulted status, including:	a. distressed restructuring treated the same as other indications of unlikeliness to pay;	1
a. distressed restructuring treated the same as other indications of unlikeliness to pay;	b. extended probation period for distressed restructuring to be specified by the institutions;	1

c. extended probation period of at least 1 year for distressed restructuring specified in the        GL;	d. return to non-default possible only after full repayment of the contract subject to        distressed restructuring.	1
Counting of days past due and the identification of indications of default in a timely and effective manner are essential for an adequate application of the default definition. In this field, the following options have been considered:	a. not specifying the frequency of counting of days past due;	1
a. not specifying the frequency of counting of days past due;	b. introducing a requirement to count days past due on a daily basis; and	1
b. introducing a requirement to count days past due on a daily basis; and	c. a general specification that the frequency of calculation should allow for timely        identification of default and adequate data to be used for risk management purposes; if	1
In theory, the stricter the definition of default is, the greater the number of defaults identified. A higher level of defaults generates higher expected loss and in the case of the SA the total exposure value of exposures classified to an asset class of defaulted exposures is higher. The effect on capital requirements, however, is not straightforward and depends on the method used by the institution to calculate capital requirements:	        In the case of institutions that use the SA more exposures are classified as defaulted, but          on the other hand a higher rate of credit risk adjustments results in lower risk weights for          defaulted exposures (100% or 150% as explained in the previous paragraphs). However,          as these are the highest levels of risk weights used in most of the other exposure classes,          it is reasonable to expect that the stricter the definition of default, the higher the riskweighted exposure amounts. In other words, the stricter the default definition, the higher          the level of defaulted exposures in the asset class where higher risk weights are assigned,          and higher risk weights are used in the calculation of own funds requirements.	1

However, the calculation of expected loss is based on a PD that is equal          to 100%; therefore, it is much higher than if the exposure was not classified as defaulted.          The stricter the default definition, the higher the expected loss. If the expected loss is not          fully covered by the credit risk adjustments then the difference is deducted from own          funds. Moreover, the definition of default also impacts the risk weights of non-defaulted          exposures through PD estimates. A stricter default definition results in a higher default          rate, higher PD estimates and higher risk weights for non-defaulted exposures.	1

The risk weight for defaulted exposures is not zero but calculated on the basis          of ELBE and LGD in-default estimates, and should represent unexpected loss in the          recovery process. It is not explicit whether the risk weight calculated in this way is higher          or lower than the risk weight for non-defaulted exposures. This depends largely on the          methodologies used by particular institutions. The definition of default also impacts the          risk weights of non-defaulted exposures through PD and LGD estimates. With regard to          PD it is clear that the stricter the definition is the higher are PD estimates and risk          weights. In the case of LGD, however, the impact would most likely be the reverse,          because a stricter definition of default might result in more defaults that would be cured          within a short period of time. This effect would decrease LGD estimates and risk weights          for non-defaulted exposures.	1
The business reorganisation plan should show that the management body or the person or persons appointed in accordance with Article 72(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU of the institution or entity referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU:	             1. support the business reorganisation plan and commit to implement it;	1

2.8        In order to determine whether the business reorganisation plan is reasonably likely to            restore the long-term viability of the institution or entity referred to in points (b), (c) and	(d) of Article 1(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU, both authorities should assess the business            reorganisation plan using the relevant provisions of the business model analysis            framework and methodology, as provided in the EBA guidelines on common procedures            and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) 3. In this            respect the resolution authority should not be expected to use such EBA guidelines            beyond what can be assumed by its experience and competence.	1
3. When assessing whether there is a material threat to financial stability arising from or    aggravated by the failure or likely failure of the institution under resolution in the context of    the requirement to market the institution relating to the application of the sale of business    tool, resolution authorities should consider the impact on other institutions and financial    markets including infrastructure providers and non-financial institution customers. Resolution    authorities should in particular consider, but not limit themselves to, factual circumstances    that are relevant for the risk that marketing the institution under resolution may result in    aggravating uncertainty and a loss of market confidence. These circumstances should include    at least any of the following:	    (a) the risk of a systemic crisis, as evident from the number, size or significance of institutions         that are at risk of meeting the conditions for early intervention or the resolution         conditions or at risk of undergoing an insolvency procedure, or as evident from public         financial support to institutions or extraordinary liquidity facilities provided by central         banks;	1
    (a) the risk of a systemic crisis, as evident from the number, size or significance of institutions         that are at risk of meeting the conditions for early intervention or the resolution         conditions or at risk of undergoing an insolvency procedure, or as evident from public         financial support to institutions or extraordinary liquidity facilities provided by central         banks;	    (b) the risk of a discontinuance of critical functions or a significant increase in prices for the         provision of these functions as evident from changes in market conditions for these         functions or their availability, or the expectation of counterparties and other market         participants in this respect;	1
    (b) the risk of a discontinuance of critical functions or a significant increase in prices for the         provision of these functions as evident from changes in market conditions for these         functions or their availability, or the expectation of counterparties and other market         participants in this respect;	    (c) the withdrawal of short-term funding or deposits;	1
    (c) the withdrawal of short-term funding or deposits;	    (d) decreases in share prices of institutions or in prices of assets held by institutions, in         particular where they can have an impact on the capital situation of institutions;	1
    (d) decreases in share prices of institutions or in prices of assets held by institutions, in         particular where they can have an impact on the capital situation of institutions;	    (e) a reduction in short or medium-term funding available to institutions;	1
                                                                                                     6 GL ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SALE OF BUSINESS TOOL	    (f) an impairment to the functioning of the interbank funding market, as particularly         apparent from an increase in margin requirements and a decrease in collateral available         to institutions;	1
    (f) an impairment to the functioning of the interbank funding market, as particularly         apparent from an increase in margin requirements and a decrease in collateral available         to institutions;	    (g) increases in prices for credit default insurance or a decrease in ratings of institutions or         other market participants that are relevant with respect to the financial situation of         institutions.	1
5. When assessing whether compliance with the requirements specified in Article 39(1) of    Directive 2014/59/EU would be likely to undermine the effectiveness of the sale of business    tool or achieving the resolution objective of avoiding significant adverse effects on financial    stability, resolution authorities should consider at least the following elements:	    (a) With regard to the requirement of transparency stipulated in point (a) of Article 39(2) of         Directive 2014/59/EU, the risk that marketing to a wider circle of potential purchasers         and that the disclosure of risks and valuations or the identification of critical and noncritical functions in respect of the institution under resolution may result in additional         uncertainty and in a loss of market confidence. In particular, preparations for the         marketing process should not increase the risk that the institution may enter resolution.	1

In particular, preparations for the         marketing process should not increase the risk that the institution may enter resolution.	    (b) With regard to the principle of non-discrimination established by point (b) of Article 39(2)         of Directive 2014/59/EU, the fact that certain potential purchasers may be more likely to         ensure financial stability, in particular due to factors such as their financial or market         position, their structure and business model, which may facilitate the business integration         and the legal and organisational feasibility or may have positive effects on the time         required for the implementation of the resolution action and the expectation that critical         functions can be continued. Resolution authorities should take into account the needs         and expectations of counterparties, infrastructure providers, depositors and liquidity         providers and those of the wider market.	1
    (b) With regard to the principle of non-discrimination established by point (b) of Article 39(2)         of Directive 2014/59/EU, the fact that certain potential purchasers may be more likely to         ensure financial stability, in particular due to factors such as their financial or market         position, their structure and business model, which may facilitate the business integration         and the legal and organisational feasibility or may have positive effects on the time         required for the implementation of the resolution action and the expectation that critical         functions can be continued. Resolution authorities should take into account the needs         and expectations of counterparties, infrastructure providers, depositors and liquidity         providers and those of the wider market.	    (c) Resolution authorities should ensure that arrangements to ascertain that parties involved         in the marketing process are free from conflicts of interest as stipulated by point (c) of         Article 39(2) of Directive 2014/59/EU do not impede the practicability and the timely         implementation of the resolution action. Resolution authorities should take into account         that, given the limited number of service providers, advisers and potential purchasers in         the market, a certain risk of conflicts of interests may be inherent to the sales process.	1
                                                                                                  7 GL ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SALE OF BUSINESS TOOL	    (d) When assessing whether advantages to potential purchasers are unfair within the         meaning of point (d) of Directive 2014/59/EU, resolution authorities should take into         account that the resolution objectives and the need for rapid action may justify         incentivising purchasers or limiting their risk, in particular in the context of the use of the         financing arrangements for these purposes as mentioned in Article 101(1) of         Directive 2014/59/EU.	1
    (d) When assessing whether advantages to potential purchasers are unfair within the         meaning of point (d) of Directive 2014/59/EU, resolution authorities should take into         account that the resolution objectives and the need for rapid action may justify         incentivising purchasers or limiting their risk, in particular in the context of the use of the         financing arrangements for these purposes as mentioned in Article 101(1) of         Directive 2014/59/EU.	    (e) When aiming to maximise the sale price as required by point (f) of Directive 2014/59/EU,         resolution authorities should take into account the need for rapid action, which may be in         conflict with prolonged price negotiations or bidding processes, and the resolution         objectives, in particular the continuance of critical functions, which may be in conflict         with maximising the sale price for certain business areas. In addition, resolution         authorities should take into account that certain potential purchasers may be more likely         to ensure financial stability, in particular due to factors such as their financial or market         position, their structure and business model.	1
Article 39(4) of Directive 2014/59/EU requires the EBA to develop guidelines that specify the factual circumstances amounting to a material threat and the elements relating to the effectiveness of the sale of business tool that the resolution authorities should account for when:	           there is a material threat to financial stability arising from or aggravated by the failure of             likely failure of the institution under resolution; and	1
           there is a material threat to financial stability arising from or aggravated by the failure of             likely failure of the institution under resolution; and	           the compliance with the requirements 1 would be likely to undermine the effectiveness of             the sale of business tool in addressing the threat or achieving the resolution objective.	1
The core problem that the guidelines aim to address is the lack of a harmonised approach when the resolution authorities interpret these elements for assessment. A lack of consistency and potential variations in the interpretation of these elements may lead to:	        Asymmetric information between resolution authorities. This is important in particular          when the institution in question has a large cross-border dimension. To handle crossborder cases, resolution authorities may need to work in cooperation. Asymmetric          information between resolution authorities and a lack of information can represent an          obstacle for effective and smooth cooperation and delay the orderly resolution process.	1

    A lack of a level playing field for institutions in the EU, i.e. different treatment of various          entities belonging to the same cross-border groups due to different          supervisory/resolution practices.	        (Ex-ante) different signals to the market players, i.e. the agents such as counterparties,          infrastructure providers, depositors, liquidity providers and the wider market players may          have different expectations of the regulatory process. Different expectations may also          turn into uncertainty when there is a cross-border dimension since the same agent may          receive different signals from different resolution authorities.	1
This section presents the major technical options discussed during the preparation of the draft guidelines and presents qualitatively the potential costs and benefits associated with the preferred options.	a.       Technical options related to the scope of ‘material threat’	1
The preferred option in this assessment is Option 2b, for two reasons:	        There are great variations across cases that the resolution authorities will potentially          handle. These variations arise from the nature, scale and intensity of the crisis and the          affected markets, and the characteristics particular to the institution, e.g. size,          interconnectedness, business model.	1

Whether the evaluation of credit risk is conducted on a collective or    individual basis, a credit institution should be able to demonstrate that this consideration has    occurred so that the recognition of ECL is not delayed. Such criteria should result in the    identification of factors that affect repayment, whether related to borrower incentives,    willingness or ability to perform on the contractual obligations, or lending exposure terms and    conditions. Economic factors considered (such as unemployment rates or occupancy rates)    should be relevant to the assessment and, depending on the circumstances, this may be at    the international, national, regional or local level;	1

With respect to factors related to the character, capacity and capital of borrowers, the terms     of lending exposures, and the values of assets pledged as collateral together with other credit     risk mitigants that may affect the full collectability of cash flows, a credit institution should     (depending on the type of exposure) consider:	a. its lending policies and procedures, including its underwriting standards and lending terms,    that were in effect upon initial recognition of the borrower’s lending exposure, and whether    the lending exposure was originated as an exception to this policy.

38. Sound credit risk methodologies should consider different potential scenarios and should not     rely purely on subjective, biased or overly optimistic considerations. Credit institutions should     develop and document their processes to generate relevant scenarios to be used in the     estimation of ECL. In particular:	a. credit institutions should demonstrate and document how ECL estimates would alter with    changes in scenarios, including changes to relevant external conditions that may impact ECL    estimates or components of the ECL calculation (such as PD and LGD parameters);	1

For outsourced scenarios, credit    institutions should ensure that the external provider tailors the scenarios to reflect the credit    institutions’ business and credit risk exposure profile, as credit institutions remain responsible    for those scenarios;	1

40. Senior management should be able to demonstrate that it understands and appropriately     considers inherent risks when pricing lending exposures. Credit institutions should take     particular care of the following fact patterns, which are potentially indicative of inadequate     estimates of ECL:	a. the granting of credit to borrowers based on fragile income streams (that could become nonrecurrent upon a downturn) or with no documentation or limited verification of borrower    income sources;	1

Renegotiations/modifications should not automatically lead to the conclusion that               there has been an immediate decrease in the credit risk of the exposure. Any               decrease in the reported allowance level due to improved credit risk should be               supported by strong evidence. Customers should demonstrate consistently               satisfactory payment performance over a reasonable period of time before credit risk               would be considered to have decreased, considering also the relevant requirements               for exposures in the probation period as defined in Part 2 of Annex V of Commission               Implementing Regulation (EU) 680/2014.	1

Credit institutions should carefully consider whether the collection of loan principal is               reasonably assured when repayment performance takes the form of interest               payments alone, subsequent to a renegotiation or modification. In addition, further               expected delays in the payment of those cash flows may evidence that credit risk has               not improved, and thus the level of ECL should be reassessed carefully.	1

Clear roles and responsibilities for model validation with adequate independence and    competence. Model validation should be performed independently of the model    development process and by staff with the necessary experience and expertise. The findings    and outcomes of model validation should be reported in a prompt and timely manner to the    appropriate level of authority. Where a credit institution has outsourced its validation    function to an external party, the credit institution remains responsible for the effectiveness    of all model validation work and should ensure that the work done by the external party    meets the elements of a sound model validation framework on an ongoing basis.	1

An appropriate model validation scope and methodology should include a systematic process    of evaluating the model’s robustness, consistency and accuracy as well as its continued    relevance to the underlying individual lending exposure or portfolio. An effective model    validation process should also enable potential limitations of a model to be identified and    addressed on a timely basis. The scope for validation should include a review of model inputs,    model design and model outputs/performance.	1

Data used to estimate ECL allowances should be relevant to the credit institutions’         portfolios and, as far as possible, accurate, reliable and complete (i.e. without exclusions         that could bias ECL estimates). Validation should ensure that the data used meet these         standards.	1

From a forward-looking perspective, validation should also assess the extent to which the         model, at the overall model and individual risk factor level, can take into consideration         changes in the economic or credit environment, as well as changes to portfolio business         profile or strategy, without significantly reducing model robustness.	1

Comprehensive documentation of the model validation framework and process. This should    include documenting the validation procedures performed, any changes in validation    methodology and tools, the range of data used, validation results and any remedial actions	1
    taken where necessary. Credit institutions should ensure that the documentation is regularly     reviewed and updated.	d. A review of the model validation process by independent parties (e.g. internal or external    parties) to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the model validation process and the    independence of the model validation process from the development process. The findings of    the review should be reported in a prompt and timely manner to the appropriate level of    authority (e.g. senior management, audit committee).	1

107.   Credit institutions should consider in particular the following non-exhaustive list of    indicators in assessing a significant increase in credit risk:	a. a decision by the credit institution’s senior management such that, if an existing lending    exposure were newly originated at the reporting date, the element of the price of the lending    exposure that reflects the credit risk of the exposure would be significantly higher than it was    when the loan was actually originated, because of an increase in the credit risk of the specific    borrower or class of borrowers since inception;	1

c. a downgrade of a borrower by a recognised credit rating agency, or within a credit    institution’s internal credit rating system;	d. for performing lending exposures subject to individual monitoring and review, an internal    credit assessment summary/credit-quality indicator that is weaker than upon initial    recognition;	1

e. deterioration of relevant determinants of credit risk (e.g. future cash flows) for an individual    obligor (or pool of obligors); and	f.   expectation of modification due to financial difficulties, including those qualifying as      forbearance in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/227.	1
108.   When assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk for a lending    exposure, credit institutions should also take into account the following factors which are    related to the environment in which a credit institution or the borrower operates:	a. deterioration of the macroeconomic outlook relevant to a particular borrower or to a group    of borrowers. Macroeconomic assessments should be sufficiently rich to include factors    relevant to sovereign, corporate, household and other types of borrower. Furthermore, they    should address any relevant regional differences in economic performance within a    jurisdiction 31; and	1

Furthermore, they    should address any relevant regional differences in economic performance within a    jurisdiction 31; and	b. deterioration of prospects for the sector or industries within which a borrower operates.	1
125.   When determining whether there is a significant increase in credit risk for a modified    lending exposure, credit institutions should be able to demonstrate, and should take into    account when developing ECL estimates, whether such modifications or renegotiations have    improved or restored the ability of the credit institution to collect interest and principal    payments compared with the situation upon initial recognition. Consideration should also be    given to the substance of modified contractual cash flows as well as the implications of the    modifications for the future credit risk of the lending exposure (taking into consideration the    obligor’s credit risk). Factors to consider include, but are not limited to, the following:	a. whether the modification or renegotiation of the contractual terms and resulting cash flows is    economically beneficial to the obligor, compared with the original, unmodified contractual    terms, and how the modification economically affects the obligor’s ability to repay the debt;	1
a. whether the modification or renegotiation of the contractual terms and resulting cash flows is    economically beneficial to the obligor, compared with the original, unmodified contractual    terms, and how the modification economically affects the obligor’s ability to repay the debt;	b. whether factors can be identified that support a credit institution’s assessment of the    obligor’s ability to repay the debt, including circumstances leading up to the modification, and    future prospects of the obligor as a result of the modifications, considering current    conditions, macroeconomic forecasts, and prospects for the sector/industry within which the	1
139.   Competent authorities should be satisfied that credit institutions have adopted and    adhered to the sound credit risk practices described in these guidelines.

Where a credit institution    originates or purchases a lending exposure on which credit risk at acquisition exceeds the    institution’s risk appetite and which therefore represents an exception to the institution’s    lending policies and standards, competent authorities should evaluate whether the institution    has established and adheres to appropriate processes and controls for: the initial    identification, review, approval and documentation of such exposures; the reporting of such    policy exceptions to senior management and, for individually significant exposures, to the    management body; and the proper monitoring of such exposures after initial recognition.    Competent authorities should also evaluate whether the credit institution’s processes and    controls separately identify ECL allowance estimates related to exposures consistent with the    credit institution’s risk appetite and those related to riskier lending exposures;	1

141.   In assessing the methods employed by a credit institution to estimate allowances,    competent authorities should be satisfied that the credit institution is following policies and    practices consistent with the ECL measurement principles outlined in these guidelines,    including, but not limited to, the following:	a. the procedures used by a credit institution to measure ECL are robust and timely and take    into account criteria such as updated valuations of credit risk mitigants (and, in particular,    collateral, the residual risk after taking into account the mitigants, the correlation of that risk    with borrowers’ creditworthiness and the potential impact in terms of the effectiveness of    protection), cash flow estimates based on assessments of borrower-specific factors and    current and future macroeconomic conditions, together with other relevant forward-looking    information that affects the expected collectability of the credit institution’s lending    exposure;	1

c. aggregate allowances on lending exposures are appropriate in accordance with relevant    accounting requirements and in relation to the credit risk exposure in the credit institution’s    portfolio;	d. uncollectability is recognised in the appropriate period through allowances or write-offs; and	1
d. uncollectability is recognised in the appropriate period through allowances or write-offs; and	e. regardless of the method used to determine ECL, the credit institution’s internal processes for    measuring ECL take account of the credit risk that the credit institution has taken on and    changes in the credit risk of the credit institution’s lending exposures.	1
145.    In performing their assessments, competent authorities should consider whether a credit    institution has:	a. maintained effective systems and controls for identifying, measuring, monitoring and    controlling the level of credit risk, significant increases in credit risk and asset quality    problems in a timely manner;	1
a. maintained effective systems and controls for identifying, measuring, monitoring and    controlling the level of credit risk, significant increases in credit risk and asset quality    problems in a timely manner;	b. analysed all significant relevant factors that affect credit risk and the collectability of the    portfolio; and	1
b. analysed all significant relevant factors that affect credit risk and the collectability of the    portfolio; and	c. established an acceptable allowance estimation process that, at a minimum, meets the    principles set out in these guidelines, including the relevant accounting requirements.	1
At a more specific level, these guidelines aim at:	     a) promoting the consistent application of accounting requirements related to the         application of an expected loss accounting framework, leading to comparable financial         information; and	1
     a) promoting the consistent application of accounting requirements related to the         application of an expected loss accounting framework, leading to comparable financial         information; and	     b) promoting the high-quality and robust application of an expected loss accounting         framework, leading to the estimation of adequate amounts of expected credit losses.	1
In conclusion, the subject matter (loans and advances) and the scope of application of these guidelines (more than 75% of the total assets of the EU banking sector) indicate that these guidelines are relevant to a significant part of the EU banking sector, and the issuance of EBA own initiative guidelines in order to meet the objectives of the guidelines noted above is considered to be of high importance. The potential costs, if the objectives of these guidelines are not met in the	43   Credit institutions may also submit supervisory data under IFRS Standards on an individual and/or sub-consolidated basis under national regulation. 44    Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international    accounting   standards     (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:02002R1606- 20080410). 45      http://ec.europa.eu/finance/company-reporting/docs/legal_framework/20140718-ias-use-of-options_en.pdf 46    Supervisory reporting includes the consolidated financial statements of credit institutions applying IFRS Standards (including both listed and non-listed).	1
2. Executive Summary Article 100(6) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on Payment Services in the Internal Market (PSD2) requires the European Banking Authority (EBA), after consulting the European Central Bank (ECB), to issue Guidelines addressed to the competent authorities (CAs) under PSD2 on the complaints procedures to be taken into consideration to ensure and monitor effective compliance with PSD2. Article 99(1) of PSD2 further specifies that Member States shall ensure that procedures are set up which allow payment service users and other interested parties including consumer associations, to submit complaints to the CAs with regard to payment service providers’ (PSPs’) alleged infringements of PSD2. To fulfil this mandate, the EBA assessed existing complaints procedures that had been established by CAs pursuant to Article 80 of Directive 2007/64/EC (PSD1) and took them into account in the process of development of the Consultation Paper which was issued in February 2017. The EBA received 12 responses to the consultation from various types of market participants. While the majority of the respondents were supportive of the proposed Guidelines, some of them suggested more substantive amendments and clarifications to be made in relation to the channels for submission of complaints, the information requested from complainants, the scope of application of the Guidelines and the aggregate analysis of complaints. As a result of the assessment of the main arguments presented in the responses, the EBA introduced the following changes to the content of the Guidelines:	- a clarification that the Guidelines apply to complaints submitted by PSPs that are affected by        the situation that gave rise to the complaint;	1
- a clarification that the Guidelines apply to complaints submitted by PSPs that are affected by        the situation that gave rise to the complaint;	- a requirement for CAs to establish at least one digital channel for submission of complaints        which is accessible online;	1
- a requirement for CAs to establish at least one digital channel for submission of complaints        which is accessible online;	- a requirement for CAs to provide information to complainants on how they can access the        channels for submission of complaints, and on the contact details of any authority or body to        which the complaint might have been forwarded;	1
- a requirement for CAs to provide information to complainants on how they can access the        channels for submission of complaints, and on the contact details of any authority or body to        which the complaint might have been forwarded;	- extension of the scope of the aggregate analysis of complaints, which now also includes        information on the payment services and the provisions of PSD2 most complained about. Finally, after assessing all distinct issues raised by the market participants which were more closely related to the content of the proposed Guidelines, the EBA decided to retain the structure of the Guidelines, which continues to cover channels for submission of complaints, information requested from complainants, CAs’ reply to complainants, aggregate analysis of complaints, and documentation of and public information on the complaints procedures.	1
5.   As a result, the following aspects remain outside the scope of these Guidelines:	             a. dispute resolution procedures that PSPs have to put in place (which are covered in                 Article 101 of PSD2); and	1
             a. dispute resolution procedures that PSPs have to put in place (which are covered in                 Article 101 of PSD2); and	             b. alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures that Member States need to ensure                 exist (which are covered in Article 102 of PSD2).	1
2.1.   Competent authorities should request from complainants to provide, where possible,        information which includes but is not limited to:	         a. the identity and contact details of the complainant;	1
         a. the identity and contact details of the complainant;	         b. an indication of whether the complainant is a natural or a legal person;	1

3.1.   When responding to the complainants and, where appropriate, informing them of the        existence of alternative dispute resolution procedures in accordance with Article 99(2) of        Directive (EU) 2015/2366, competent authorities should also provide:	         a. an acknowledgment of receipt of the complaint;	1
         a. an acknowledgment of receipt of the complaint;	         b. information on the general competence of the competent authority in respect of the             procedure for complaints of alleged infringements of Directive (EU) 2015/2366;	1
         b. information on the general competence of the competent authority in respect of the             procedure for complaints of alleged infringements of Directive (EU) 2015/2366;	         c. information on whether the competent authority has forwarded the complaint to             another authority or body, which may be located in the same or in another Member             State, and including the name and contact details of that authority or body; and	1
         c. information on whether the competent authority has forwarded the complaint to             another authority or body, which may be located in the same or in another Member             State, and including the name and contact details of that authority or body; and	         d. information on either the timing and form of any further communication with the             complainant on the alleged infringement of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, or if the reply             represents the end of the complaints procedure with the competent authority.	1
4.1.   Taking into account at least the information collected under Guideline 2.1., competent        authorities should have a complaints procedure in place that allows for the aggregate        analysis of complaints of alleged infringements of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 and enables        competent authorities to identify, understand and assess, for a given timeframe:	         a. the total number of complaints of alleged infringements of Directive (EU) 2015/2366             received;	1

         e. the payment services most complained about, where possible; and	         f.   the most common measures taken by the competent authority in response to the               complaints received to ensure effective compliance with Directive (EU) 2015/2366.	1
6.1.   Competent authorities should make publicly available information on their procedures for        complaints of alleged infringements of Directive (EU) 2015/2366. This information should        be up to date and easily accessible, and include but not be limited to:	         a. the objective and scope of the complaints procedures;	1

10. In addition, for the purposes of these guidelines, IRRBB includes, in particular:	    (a) risks related to the timing mismatch in the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities and         off-balance sheet short and long-term positions (repricing risk);	1

14. Institutions should demonstrate that their internal capital is commensurate with the level of     the interest rate risk in their banking book, taking into account:	      (a) the impact on capital resources of potential changes in their economic value and future           earnings resulting from changes in the levels of interest rates, and,	1

      In measuring their exposure to IRRBB, institutions should consider and evaluate the impact of:	      (a) assumptions made in respect of non-interest bearing assets and liabilities of the banking           book (including capital and reserves);	1
      (a) assumptions made in respect of non-interest bearing assets and liabilities of the banking           book (including capital and reserves);	      (b) assumptions made in respect of customer behaviour for ‘non-maturity deposits’ (i.e. the           maturity assumed for liabilities with short contractual maturity but long behavioural           maturity);	1
      (b) assumptions made in respect of customer behaviour for ‘non-maturity deposits’ (i.e. the           maturity assumed for liabilities with short contractual maturity but long behavioural           maturity);	      (c) behavioural and automatic optionality embedded in assets or liabilities.	1
20. Institutions should implement robust internal governance arrangements with regard to IRRBB.	      (a) The institution should ensure that its management body bears the ultimate responsibility for           controlling IRRBB. The management body should determine the institution's overall IRRBB           strategy and approve the respective policies and processes.	1

The management body should determine the institution's overall IRRBB           strategy and approve the respective policies and processes.	      (b) Institutions should ensure the regular validation of the models used to quantify their IRRBB.

                                                                                                       6 GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING ACTIVITIES	    (c) Institutions’ internal risk reporting systems should provide timely and comprehensive         information about their exposures to IRRBB.	1

24. When calculating the outcome of the standard shock, institutions should apply in particular the     following:	    (a) The standard shock should be based on a sudden parallel +/- 200 basis point shift of the yield         curve (applying a 0% floor). If +/-200 basis points is lower than the actual level of change in         interest rates, calculated using the 1st and 99th percentile of observed one-day interest rate         changes over a five year period scaled up to a 240-day year, the higher level of shock arising         from the latter calculation should be applied as the standard shock.	1

(b) An appropriate general ‘risk-free’ yield curve should be applied. That curve should not         include instrument-specific or entity-specific credit risk spreads or liquidity risk spreads. An         example of an acceptable yield curve is the ‘plain vanilla’ interest rate swap curve.	1

An         example of an acceptable yield curve is the ‘plain vanilla’ interest rate swap curve.	    (c) Equity capital should be excluded from liabilities, so that the effect of the stress scenario on         the economic value of all assets, including those financed by equity capital, can be noted.	1
    (c) Equity capital should be excluded from liabilities, so that the effect of the stress scenario on         the economic value of all assets, including those financed by equity capital, can be noted.	    (d) The assumed behavioural repricing date for customer balances (liabilities) without specific         repricing dates should be constrained to a maximum average of 5 years (where the average         assumed repricing date is computed as the average of the assumed repricing dates of         different accounts subject to behavioural repricing weighted by the nominal value of all such         accounts. This means that for the computation of the average maturity, both the stable and         the volatile portion will be included).	1
                                                                                                      8 GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING ACTIVITIES	    (a) sudden up and down parallel shifts in the yield curve of varying magnitudes;	1

    (b) sudden tilts and changes in the shape of the yield curve (e.g. short-term interest rates         increasing/decreasing/remaining unchanged while medium-term and/or long-term interest         rates move at a different pace or even in opposite direction; furthermore, even within the         categories of short-term, medium-term and long-term interest rates, shocks that diverge at         different points in the yield curve);	    (c) basis risk (including that arising from changes in the relationships between key market rates);	1

    (c) scenarios based on simulations of future interest rate paths;	    (d) scenarios based on the assumptions underlying the institution's corporate profitability         forecasts.	1
28. In performing their scenario analysis, institutions should at a minimum be able to demonstrate     that:	    (a) the underlying assumptions of the internal measurement system (see 2.2. and 2.3. of this         Section) are appropriate for the different interest rate scenarios used; and	1
    (a) the underlying assumptions of the internal measurement system (see 2.2. and 2.3. of this         Section) are appropriate for the different interest rate scenarios used; and	    (b) economic consistency considerations have been properly taken into account when specifying         scenarios (e.g. consistency between interest rate shocks in different currencies and foreign         exchange rates used when computing the overall impact expressed in the institution’s base         reporting currency).	1
31. Institutions should not rely on the standardised 200-basis point parallel interest rate shock     performed for the competent authority (see IRRBB 5), but should use an appropriate range of     different stress scenarios, in particular:	    (a) sudden parallel interest rate shocks larger than 200 basis points (including extreme shifts);	1
    (a) sudden parallel interest rate shocks larger than 200 basis points (including extreme shifts);	    (b) substantial tilts and shifts in the shape of the yield curve (for instance based on those for         ongoing internal management, but with more extreme rate changes), and	1
    (b) substantial tilts and shifts in the shape of the yield curve (for instance based on those for         ongoing internal management, but with more extreme rate changes), and	    (c) substantial changes in the relationships between key market rates (basis risk).	1
32. Furthermore, stress tests should consider:	    (a) a breakdown in key assumptions about the behaviour of asset and/or liability classes;	1
    (a) a breakdown in key assumptions about the behaviour of asset and/or liability classes;	    (b) changes in key interest rate correlation assumptions;	1

Additional guidance on IRRBB 2	a) Behavioural assumptions for accounts with embedded customer optionality	1
34. In assessing the implications of such optionality, institutions should be able to take account of     the potential:	    (a) impacts on current and future loan prepayment speeds arising from the underlying economic         environment, interest rates and competitor activity;	1
    (a) impacts on current and future loan prepayment speeds arising from the underlying economic         environment, interest rates and competitor activity;	    (b) the speed/elasticity of adjustment of product rates to changes in market interest rates; and	1
    (b) the speed/elasticity of adjustment of product rates to changes in market interest rates; and	    (c) the migration of balances between product types as a result of changes in their features,         terms and conditions.	1
35. Institutions should have policies in place governing the setting of, and the regular assessment of,     the key assumptions for the treatment of on and off-balance-sheet items that have embedded     options in their interest rate risk framework. This means that institutions should:	    (a) be able to identify all material products and items subject to embedded options that could         affect either the interest rate charged or the behavioural repricing date (as opposed to         contractual maturity date) of the relevant balances;	1
    (a) be able to identify all material products and items subject to embedded options that could         affect either the interest rate charged or the behavioural repricing date (as opposed to         contractual maturity date) of the relevant balances;	    (b) have appropriate pricing and risk mitigation strategies (e.g. use of derivatives) to manage the         impact of optionality within risk appetite, which may include early redemption penalties         chargeable to the customer as an offset to the potential break costs (where permitted);	1

    (f) understand the sensitivity of the institution’s risk measurement outputs to these         assumptions, including undertaking stress testing of the assumptions and taking the results         of such tests into account in internal capital allocation decisions;	    (g) perform regular internal validation of these assumptions to verify their stability over time         and to adjust them if necessary.	1
36. In making behavioural assumptions about accounts without specific repricing dates for the     purposes of interest rate risk management, institutions should:	    (a) be able to identify ‘core’ (as opposed to ‘transient’) balances on transaction accounts - i.e.         that element of the balance that is consistently kept in the customer account as distinct from         balances that are drawn down regularly and then replaced;	1

                                                                                                    11 GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING ACTIVITIES	    (d) understand the impact of the assumptions on the institution’s own chosen risk measurement         outputs, including by regularly calculating the measures using contractual terms rather than         behavioural assumptions to isolate the effects on both EV and EVR; and	1
    (d) understand the impact of the assumptions on the institution’s own chosen risk measurement         outputs, including by regularly calculating the measures using contractual terms rather than         behavioural assumptions to isolate the effects on both EV and EVR; and	    (e) undertake stress testing to understand the sensitivity of the chosen risk measures to changes         in key assumptions, taking the results of such tests into account in internal capital allocation         decisions.	1
37. If institutions decide to adopt a policy intended to stabilise earnings arising from their own     equity, they should:	    (a) have an appropriate methodology for determining what element of equity capital should be         considered eligible for such treatment (e.g. adjusting for capital invested in non-interest         earning assets such as tangible assets, intangible assets, investments in associates etc.);	1

42. When measuring IRRBB:	    (a) A base scenario should be applied to reflect the assumptions regarding business         development and customer behaviour incorporated into the institution’s business plans. The         interest rates used for repricing under the base scenario should be derived from spot or         forward rates (as appropriate) by applying suitable spreads for different instruments.	1

(b) The refinement of time bands into which the portfolio is divided should adequately reflect         the exposures in the portfolio. Institutions should particularly prevent the offsetting of large         exposures which are not actually matched by repricing date, thereby hiding yield curve risk.	1

59. The IT systems and applications used by the institution to carry out, process and record     operations as well as to generate reports should be capable of supporting the management of     IRRBB. In particular, the systems should:	    (a) be capable of fully and clearly recording all transactions made by the institution, taking into         account their IRRBB characteristics;	1
    (a) be capable of fully and clearly recording all transactions made by the institution, taking into         account their IRRBB characteristics;	    (b) be tailored to the complexity and number of transactions creating IRRBB; and	1
    (b) be tailored to the complexity and number of transactions creating IRRBB; and	    (c) offer sufficient flexibility to accommodate a reasonable range of stress scenarios and new         scenarios.	1
63. Adequate organisational controls of IT systems should be in place to prevent the corruption of     data used by IRRBB computer systems and applications, and to control changes to the coding     used in those applications, so as to ensure, in particular:	    (a) the reliability of data used as input, and the integrity of processing systems for IRRBB         models;	1
    (a) the reliability of data used as input, and the integrity of processing systems for IRRBB         models;	    (b) that the likelihood of errors occurring in the IT system, including those occurring during data         processing and aggregation, is minimised; and	1
    (b) that the likelihood of errors occurring in the IT system, including those occurring during data         processing and aggregation, is minimised; and	    (c) that adequate measures are taken if market disruptions or slumps occur.	1
71. In their ICAAP analysis of the amount of capital required for IRRBB, institutions may consider     differentiating between:	    (a) current internal capital held for risks to economic value that could arise from a sudden         interest rate shock; and	1
    (a) current internal capital held for risks to economic value that could arise from a sudden         interest rate shock; and	    (b) future internal capital requirements arising from the impact of rate changes on future         earnings capacity, and the resultant implications for internal capital buffer levels.	1
73. In addition to considering whether internal capital should be held for actual IRRBB economic     value risk, institutions should also consider:	    (a) the size and tenor of any mismatch limits intended to allow the institution to take advantage         of an interest rate expectation by creating or leaving un-hedged interest rate risk positions in         the banking book (subject to appropriate governance and within an agreed risk appetite         definition);	1
    (a) the size and tenor of any mismatch limits intended to allow the institution to take advantage         of an interest rate expectation by creating or leaving un-hedged interest rate risk positions in         the banking book (subject to appropriate governance and within an agreed risk appetite         definition);	    (b) the size and tenor of any mismatch limits put in place to allow for small timing and balance         mismatches arising from retail banking products where precise micro-hedging may be         impractical;	1
    (b) the size and tenor of any mismatch limits put in place to allow for small timing and balance         mismatches arising from retail banking products where precise micro-hedging may be         impractical;	    (c) the sensitivity of the calculated interest rate risk to imperfect modelling assumptions (model         risk); and	1
    (c) the sensitivity of the calculated interest rate risk to imperfect modelling assumptions (model         risk); and	    (d) short-term timing and other imperfections in the matching of portfolios to         behavioural/planning assumptions, or where the policy allows discretion by indicating a         duration range or allowing mismatch tolerances for behavioural items.	1
74. To calibrate the amount of internal capital to be held for IRRBB economic value risk, institutions     should use appropriate economic value measurement systems for their business profile (see 2.3     on methods for measuring interest rate risk) and an appropriate range of interest rate scenarios     (see 2.1 on scenarios and stress testing) in order to quantify the potential scale of any IRRBB     effects under stressed conditions.	    (a) Institutions should consider whether an allocation of internal capital is appropriate for some         (or all) of the economic value at risk resulting specifically from behavioural or corporate         planning assumptions (see 2.2 on measurement Assumptions).	1
    (a) Institutions should consider whether an allocation of internal capital is appropriate for some         (or all) of the economic value at risk resulting specifically from behavioural or corporate         planning assumptions (see 2.2 on measurement Assumptions).	    (b) Institutions that operate economic capital models should ensure that the internal capital         allocation for IRRBB is properly factored into the overall economic capital allocation, and that         any assumptions on diversification are documented and derived from full analysis of the         underlying correlation data. Economic capital costs may be allocated back to business units         and products to ensure that the full costs of the underlying business/products are properly         understood by those responsible for managing them.	1
    (b) Institutions that operate economic capital models should ensure that the internal capital         allocation for IRRBB is properly factored into the overall economic capital allocation, and that         any assumptions on diversification are documented and derived from full analysis of the         underlying correlation data. Economic capital costs may be allocated back to business units         and products to ensure that the full costs of the underlying business/products are properly         understood by those responsible for managing them.	    (c) Institutions that are exposed to interest risk in different currencies should ensure that all         material positions are taken into account, and that internal capital allocated for economic         value at risk allows for different changes in interest rates for each currency (as opposed to         assuming all rates for all currencies will move in parallel).	1
75. In considering whether an allocation of internal capital should be made in respect of interest EaR     (as part of a capital buffer allocation for stress testing), institutions should take into account:	    (a) the relative importance of NII to total net income, and therefore the impact of significant         variations in NII from year to year;	1
    (a) the relative importance of NII to total net income, and therefore the impact of significant         variations in NII from year to year;	    (b) the actual levels of NII achievable under different scenarios (i.e. the extent to which margins         are wide enough to absorb volatility arising from interest rate positions, changes in the cost         of liabilities); and	1
    (b) the actual levels of NII achievable under different scenarios (i.e. the extent to which margins         are wide enough to absorb volatility arising from interest rate positions, changes in the cost         of liabilities); and	    (c) the potential for actual losses to be incurred under stressed conditions, or as a result of         secular changes in the market environment, where it might become necessary to liquidate         positions that are intended as a long-term hedge to stabilise earnings.	1
Competent authorities should apply these Guidelines in the following situations:	             a.    when identifying securitisation transactions where the credit risk is not                    considered to have been transferred even though the transactions meet one of                    the conditions under Article 243(2) or 244(2) of the CRR;	1

             b.    when assessing an originator institution’s compliance with the requirements                    under Articles 243(4) and 244(4) of the CRR;	             c.    when collecting data to be provided to the EBA in accordance with Articles 243(6)                    and 244(6) of the CRR and when assessing an originator institution’s compliance                    with (i) the general requirements of the Guidelines for all transactions claiming                    SRT under Article 243 or 244 of the CRR and (ii) the specific requirements of the                    Guidelines to achieve SRT to third parties in accordance with Article 243(4) or                    244(4) of the CRR.	1
Article 243(5) and Article 244(5) of the CRR set out conditions that should be met, in addition to the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 4, in order to apply the securitisation framework. For traditional securitisations Article 243(5) of the CRR specifically requires the following conditions to be met:	             a.    the securitisation documentation reflects the economic substance of the                    transaction;	1
             a.    the securitisation documentation reflects the economic substance of the                    transaction;	             b.    the securitised exposures are put beyond the reach of the originator institution                    and its creditors, including in bankruptcy and receivership. This shall be supported                    by the opinion of qualified legal counsel;	1
             b.    the securitised exposures are put beyond the reach of the originator institution                    and its creditors, including in bankruptcy and receivership. This shall be supported                    by the opinion of qualified legal counsel;	             c.    the securities issued do not represent payment obligations of the originator                    institution;	1
             c.    the securities issued do not represent payment obligations of the originator                    institution;	             d.    the originator institution does not maintain effective or indirect control over the                    transferred exposures. An originator shall be considered to have maintained                    effective control over the transferred exposures if it has the right to repurchase                    from the transferee the previously transferred exposures in order to realise their                    benefits or if it is obligated to re-assume transferred risk. The originator                    institution's retention of servicing rights or obligations in respect of the exposures                    shall not of itself constitute indirect control of the exposures;	1
             d.    the originator institution does not maintain effective or indirect control over the                    transferred exposures. An originator shall be considered to have maintained                    effective control over the transferred exposures if it has the right to repurchase                    from the transferee the previously transferred exposures in order to realise their                    benefits or if it is obligated to re-assume transferred risk. The originator                    institution's retention of servicing rights or obligations in respect of the exposures                    shall not of itself constitute indirect control of the exposures;	             e.    the securitisation documentation meets all the following conditions:	1

1.   Competent authorities should assess the documentation and evidence provided by the      originator institution relating to the securitisation in order to determine whether      commensurate credit risk has been transferred to third parties and require additional      information, where this is needed to conduct the assessment. Competent authorities should      pay particular attention to amongst others, the following factors, as applicable:	             a.    the risk-weighted exposure amounts and, as relevant, expected loss amounts                    calculated for the securitised exposures before securitisation and the                    corresponding amounts for the tranches transferred and retained by the                    originator institution after securitisation;	1

2.   For traditional securitisations, only the following call options granted to originator      institutions should not be considered detrimental to achieving effective transfer of credit risk      by competent authorities, provided these call options do not grant an originator institution      the right to repurchase from the transferee the previously transferred exposure to realise      their benefits or oblige the originator institution to re-assume transferred credit risk:	              a. regulatory call options or tax call options that are only exercisable if there are                  changes of the legal or regulatory framework that have an impact on the content                  of the contractual relationship of the respective securitisation transaction or that                  affect the distribution of economic benefits derived from the respective                  securitisation transaction by any of the parties in the transaction;	1

11.Institutions should include in the recovery plan at least the following mandatory categories of    recovery plan indicators which are explained in Titles III to VI of these Guidelines:	         •    capital indicators;	1
         •    capital indicators;	•    liquidity indicators;	1
•    liquidity indicators;	•    profitability indicators;	1
•    profitability indicators;	•    asset quality indicators.	1
12.Additionally, institutions should include in the recovery plan the two following categories of    recovery plan indicators which are explained in Titles VII and VIII of these Guidelines, unless    they provide satisfactory justifications to the competent authorities that such categories are    not relevant to the legal structure, risk profile, size and/or complexity of the institution (i.e. a    rebuttable presumption):	         •    market-based indicators;	1
         •    market-based indicators;	•    macroeconomic indicators.	1
15.The framework of recovery plan indicators should:	     a) be adapted to the business model and strategy of an institution and be adequate to its         risk profile. It should identify the key vulnerabilities most likely to impact the institution’s         financial situation and lead to the point at which it has to decide whether to activate the         recovery plan;	1

In particular, the number of         indicators should be sufficient to alert the institution of deteriorating conditions in a         variety of areas. At the same time, this number of indicators should be adequately         targeted and manageable by institutions;	1
     b) be adequate to the size and complexity of each institution.

37.Market-based indicators aim to capture the expectations from market participants of a rapidly    deteriorating financial condition of the institution that could potentially lead to disruptions in    access to funding and capital markets. In accordance with this objective, the framework of    qualitative and quantitative indicators should refer to the following types of indicators:	   a)    equity-based indicators which capture variations in the share price of listed companies, or          ratios that measure the relationship between the book and market value of equity;	1
   a)    equity-based indicators which capture variations in the share price of listed companies, or          ratios that measure the relationship between the book and market value of equity;	   b)    debt-based indicators, capturing expectations from wholesale funding providers such as          credit default swaps or debt spreads;	1
   b)    debt-based indicators, capturing expectations from wholesale funding providers such as          credit default swaps or debt spreads;	   c)    portfolio-related indicators, capturing expectations in relation to specific asset classes          relevant to each institution (e.g. real estate);	1

40.The macroeconomic indicators should include the following typologies:	   a)    geographical macroeconomic indicators, relating to various jurisdictions to which the          institution is exposed, giving also consideration to risks stemming from potential legal          barriers;	1
   a)    geographical macroeconomic indicators, relating to various jurisdictions to which the          institution is exposed, giving also consideration to risks stemming from potential legal          barriers;	   b)    sectoral macroeconomic indicators, relating to major specific sectors of economic activity          to which the institution is exposed (e.g. shipping, real estate).	1
1. National supervisory authorities with responsibility for banking supervision are recommended to intensify their assessments of the funding and liquidity risks incurred by credit institutions, as well as their funding risk management, within the broader balance-sheet structure, and should in particular:	(a) assess the funding plans provided by credit institutions and their feasibility for each national banking system, on an aggregated basis, taking into account the business model and risk appetite of each institution;	1
(a) assess the funding plans provided by credit institutions and their feasibility for each national banking system, on an aggregated basis, taking into account the business model and risk appetite of each institution;	(b) monitor the development of funding structures in order to identify innovative instruments, request information on such instruments and analyse the information obtained to understand how risks may shift within the financial system;	1
(b) monitor the development of funding structures in order to identify innovative instruments, request information on such instruments and analyse the information obtained to understand how risks may shift within the financial system;	(c) monitor the level, evolution and behaviour of uninsured deposit-like financial instruments, which are sold to retail customers, and their potentially negative effects on traditional deposits.	1

    5. Competent authorities should determine the appropriate level of consolidation for the        reporting of the funding plans having regard to the following considerations:	•   Adequacy of information: competent authorities should ensure that the information           collected enables them to form a clear view on the funding of their national banking           system and on the potential impact of the funding plans, when executed, on the supply           of credit to their national real economy and should decide on whether to collect           additional information that is mostly related to the funding of other (particularly nonEU ) national banking systems.	1
•   Adequacy of information: competent authorities should ensure that the information           collected enables them to form a clear view on the funding of their national banking           system and on the potential impact of the funding plans, when executed, on the supply           of credit to their national real economy and should decide on whether to collect           additional information that is mostly related to the funding of other (particularly nonEU ) national banking systems.	      •   Proportionality: competent authorities should ensure that the institution’s resources are           taken into account for the determination of the level of consolidation for the application           of the Funding Plan Template. Competent authorities should pay particular attention to           the existence of liquidity sub-groups in order to determine the appropriate level of           consolidation for liquidity purposes.	1
The RTS on economic downturn set out the requirements for the identification of an economic downturn for the type of exposures covered by a rating system. As a rating system may, however, cover exposures from different businesses, sectors and geographical areas, the notion of an economic downturn set forth in the RTS may comprise several distinct downturn periods. The GL for downturn LGD estimation provide guidance on how to calibrate downturn LGD appropriate for an economic downturn, taking into account the downturn period(s) identified in accordance with the RTS. To this end, the GL differentiate three types of approaches for calibrating downturn LGD:	            (i) type 1 approaches, based on the observed impact on losses of a particular downturn             period;	1
            (i) type 1 approaches, based on the observed impact on losses of a particular downturn             period;	            (ii) type 2 approaches, where such an impact on losses has not been observed (e.g. because             the downturn periods identified in accordance with the RTS have occurred too long ago)             but the impact can be estimated using a limited set of methodologies;	1
                                                                                                                      3 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN	           (iii) type 3 approaches, where neither type 1 nor type 2 approaches can be applied and            therefore institutions may apply their preferred modelling approach but have to comply            with a minimum margin of conservatism (MoC) requirement.	1
    11.In line with the general principle of the internal ratings-based approach that the quantification        of risk parameters should be based on observed data, the calibration of downturn LGD should        be based on the observed impact of the downturn period on the relevant losses, where        possible, and, where not, it should make use of certain methodologies. The GL therefore        differentiate between three approaches, introduced in paragraphs 23 to 25, which are        increasing in prescriptiveness and with regard to aspects that need to be covered by        appropriate MoC:	             i. Type 1: downturn LGD calibration based on observed impact. Where sufficient (in                 terms of timespan covered and quantity of data, to arrive at stable estimates) loss                 data are available to assess the impact for the downturn period under consideration,                 which has been identified in accordance with the RTS on economic downturn, the                 institution should conduct a standardised impact assessment with a prescriptive                 minimum scope. The impact assessment requires that institutions analyse whether                 there is evidence of elevated realised LGDs, decreased annual recoveries, decreased                 number of cures (i.e. exposures that defaulted and returned to non-defaulted status)                 or prolonged time in default caused by the downturn period under consideration.                 Downturn LGD should then be calibrated for the downturn period under consideration                 in a way that it is coherent with the results obtained from that impact assessment, i.e.                 the institution is required to consider the results of the impact assessment and to                 model appropriately the loss components materially affected by the downturn period                 under consideration.	1
             i. Type 1: downturn LGD calibration based on observed impact. Where sufficient (in                 terms of timespan covered and quantity of data, to arrive at stable estimates) loss                 data are available to assess the impact for the downturn period under consideration,                 which has been identified in accordance with the RTS on economic downturn, the                 institution should conduct a standardised impact assessment with a prescriptive                 minimum scope. The impact assessment requires that institutions analyse whether                 there is evidence of elevated realised LGDs, decreased annual recoveries, decreased                 number of cures (i.e. exposures that defaulted and returned to non-defaulted status)                 or prolonged time in default caused by the downturn period under consideration.                 Downturn LGD should then be calibrated for the downturn period under consideration                 in a way that it is coherent with the results obtained from that impact assessment, i.e.                 the institution is required to consider the results of the impact assessment and to                 model appropriately the loss components materially affected by the downturn period                 under consideration.	             ii. Type 2: downturn LGD calibration based on estimated impact using historical loss                  data (haircut or extrapolation approach or a combination of the two). Where loss                  data are not available to base the downturn LGD calibration on an observed impact                  for a considered downturn period, the downturn LGD should be calibrated using a                  haircut approach or an extrapolation approach. The approaches may also be                                                                                                       9 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN	1
                  combined and be used for the downturn calibration of intermediate risk parameters                   (such as recovery rates or cure rates) and risk drivers.	              iii. Type 3: free modelling flexibility with minimum fixed add-on. Where sufficient data                    are not available to quantify downturn LGDs for the downturn period under                    consideration based on observed or estimated impact using the approaches outlined                    in points (i) and (ii) above, the institution still has to provide downturn LGD estimates,                    given the explicit requirement in the CRR. However, in this case, the estimates also                    need to fulfil a minimum level of MoC, covering the lack of data and methodological                    deficiencies. Moreover, the institution must justify to the satisfaction of the                    competent authority that it can apply neither the approach outlined in point (i) nor                    the approach outlined in point (ii) above. Under this third approach, it is required that                    the final downturn LGD estimates plus an appropriate MoC be higher than the                    corresponding long-run-average LGDs plus 15 percentage points (capped at a final                    downturn LGD estimate level of 105%).	1
    15.This means in particular that the concept of the MoC laid down in the GL on PD and LGD        estimation should also be applied to downturn LGD estimation. Therefore, the MoC for        downturn LGD estimation should be assessed in accordance with the requirements set out in        subsection 4.4 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation. In particular, this means that institutions        should:	        a.   identify all deficiencies related to the estimation of downturn LGDs that may lead to a bias              in the quantification of the estimates or to an increased uncertainty which is not captured              by the general estimation error specifically related to the downturn LGD estimation in              accordance with the guidance set out in subsection 4.4.1 of the GL on PD and LGD              estimation;	1
        a.   identify all deficiencies related to the estimation of downturn LGDs that may lead to a bias              in the quantification of the estimates or to an increased uncertainty which is not captured              by the general estimation error specifically related to the downturn LGD estimation in              accordance with the guidance set out in subsection 4.4.1 of the GL on PD and LGD              estimation;	        b.   apply appropriate adjustments (as described in subsection 4.4.2 of the GL on PD and LGD              estimation) to overcome the identified deficiencies in order to provide a more accurate              downturn LGD estimation; and	1
                                                                                                      11 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN	        c.   reflect the uncertainty of the downturn LGD estimation (including appropriate              adjustments) by quantifying an MoC subdivided into three categories:	1
        c.   reflect the uncertainty of the downturn LGD estimation (including appropriate              adjustments) by quantifying an MoC subdivided into three categories:	i. Category A: MoC related to data and methodological deficiencies identified under                       Category A as referred to in paragraph 36(a) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation;	1
i. Category A: MoC related to data and methodological deficiencies identified under                       Category A as referred to in paragraph 36(a) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation;	ii. Category B: MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk                       appetite, collection and recovery policies and any other source of additional                       uncertainty identified under Category B as referred to in paragraph 36(b) of the                       GL on PD and LGD estimation; and	1
ii. Category B: MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk                       appetite, collection and recovery policies and any other source of additional                       uncertainty identified under Category B as referred to in paragraph 36(b) of the                       GL on PD and LGD estimation; and	iii. Category C: MoC related to the general estimation error.	1
    19.Given that, in the case of multiple downturn periods, institutions may have to use different        approaches in order to set the calibration target, it is important to specify in detail how this        interaction should work, which will in turn specify which final downturn LGD estimates should        be selected. Therefore, three principles are laid down in the policy:	             i. First, the proposed policy requires that the final downturn LGD estimates relate to one                 downturn period per calibration segment.	1
             i. First, the proposed policy requires that the final downturn LGD estimates relate to one                 downturn period per calibration segment.	             ii. Second, where for one of the downturn periods identified downturn LGD is calibrated                  using a type 3 approach and for another downturn period downturn LGD is calibrated                  using a type 1 or type 2 approach, then the latter shall be taken into account for the                  final LGD downturn estimates and an MoC needs to be added for the lack of analysis                  of one downturn period. In brief, downturn LGD estimation subject to the minimum                  add-on is disregarded where downturn LGD estimation is possible based on observed                  or estimated impact for any other downturn period subject to an additional                  appropriate MoC. Under no circumstances should this principle be abused to                  circumvent the obligatory use of type 2 approaches where their application is possible.                  Indeed, it is expected that type 3 approaches will be considered only in exceptional                  cases. Therefore, the waiver for downturn periods that require a type 3 approach as                  set out in paragraph 15(a)(iv) of the GL will be revised by the EBA, should there be                  indications of excessive or misuse of this waiver.	1
             ii. Second, where for one of the downturn periods identified downturn LGD is calibrated                  using a type 3 approach and for another downturn period downturn LGD is calibrated                  using a type 1 or type 2 approach, then the latter shall be taken into account for the                  final LGD downturn estimates and an MoC needs to be added for the lack of analysis                  of one downturn period. In brief, downturn LGD estimation subject to the minimum                  add-on is disregarded where downturn LGD estimation is possible based on observed                  or estimated impact for any other downturn period subject to an additional                  appropriate MoC. Under no circumstances should this principle be abused to                  circumvent the obligatory use of type 2 approaches where their application is possible.                  Indeed, it is expected that type 3 approaches will be considered only in exceptional                  cases. Therefore, the waiver for downturn periods that require a type 3 approach as                  set out in paragraph 15(a)(iv) of the GL will be revised by the EBA, should there be                  indications of excessive or misuse of this waiver.	            iii. Third, where LGD estimates are quantified for several downturn periods, institutions                  should choose as the finally relevant downturn period the period that results in the                  highest average downturn LGD for the calibration segment under consideration. It is                  important to note that this refers to the average downturn LGD of the latest available                  snapshot of the current non-defaulted portfolio at the time of calibration.	1
      Therefore, in this example (where it is assumed that all three products are homogeneously       managed), for both calibration segments the institution should analyse the impact of       downturn periods identified in accordance with the RTS by considering the following economic       factors:	               i. GDP growth and unemployment rate, which are relevant economic factors for all                   exposure categories, according to Article 2(1)(a) of the final draft RTS on economic                   downturn;	1
               i. GDP growth and unemployment rate, which are relevant economic factors for all                   exposure categories, according to Article 2(1)(a) of the final draft RTS on economic                   downturn;	              ii. house price index, which according to Article 2(1)(b)(i) of the final draft RTS on                   economic downturn is relevant to the exposure category ‘corporate and retail                   residential real estate’;	1
              ii. house price index, which according to Article 2(1)(b)(i) of the final draft RTS on                   economic downturn is relevant to the exposure category ‘corporate and retail                   residential real estate’;	              iii. household debt 1 , which according to Article 2(b)(i) of the RTS on economic                    downturn is relevant to the exposure category ‘retail other than i., ii. or iii’.	1
24.The policy proposed in paragraph 16 of the GL provides guidance related to the first sentence of    Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR, which requires that institutions use LGD estimates that are appropriate    for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average LGD (LRA).    The GL clarify how this requirement should be interpreted in the context of calibration of downturn    LGD. It should be noted, however, that this requirement to compare downturn and long-run    average LGD used for calibration is without prejudice to the requirement in Article 181(1)(b) of the    CRR to ensure that the actual downturn LGD estimates are used (in application) if they are more    conservative than long-run average LGDs. In general, and technically speaking, downturn LGD may    be calibrated in either of the following ways:	        a)   directly, independently of the long-run average LGD estimation or	1
        a)   directly, independently of the long-run average LGD estimation or	        b)   by an adjustment to the long-run average LGD.	1
Assume the institution found evidence of:	i. an increase of about 2% in realised LGDs due to the downturn period under                       consideration;	1
i. an increase of about 2% in realised LGDs due to the downturn period under                       consideration;	ii. a decrease of about 15% in annual recoveries due to the downturn period under                        consideration.	1
    61.The policy in paragraph 30 requires the use of a haircut approach if both of the following        conditions are fulfilled:	             i. There are not sufficient data to calibrate downturn LGDs based on observed impact                 on loss data (i.e. the policy laid down in paragraph 24 applies).	1
             i. There are not sufficient data to calibrate downturn LGDs based on observed impact                 on loss data (i.e. the policy laid down in paragraph 24 applies).	             ii. An economic factor that has been identified as a relevant economic factor in                  accordance with Article 2 of the RTS on economic downturn relates to a relevant type                  of collateral for the type of exposure under consideration and is a direct or                  transformed input of the institution’s model for LGD estimation.	1
    As an example of an extrapolation approach, an institution could develop a statistical model for     the dependency of	                      i. average yearly realised LGD values 𝑌𝑡 and	1
                      i. average yearly realised LGD values 𝑌𝑡 and	                     ii. economic factors 𝑒𝑡1 , 𝑒𝑡2 , … which should be identified according to the RTS on                          economic downturn, for the considered type of exposure, e.g. using a linear                          regression:	1
    67.The approach described in paragraph 32(b)(ii) of the GL should be limited to specific cases.        Therefore, the policy sets out several restrictions on the use of this approach, clarifying that        the approach may be followed only:	                     i. for intermediate parameters and risk drivers (e.g. cure rates or recovery rates) and	1
                     i. for intermediate parameters and risk drivers (e.g. cure rates or recovery rates) and	                    ii. where the major shares of economic loss are covered already by a haircut or                         extrapolation approach and	1
                    ii. where the major shares of economic loss are covered already by a haircut or                         extrapolation approach and	                    iii. where no statistically significant dependency can be established on the                          intermediate parameter or risk driver under consideration and	1
                    iii. where no statistically significant dependency can be established on the                          intermediate parameter or risk driver under consideration and	                    iv. where the intermediate parameter or risk driver under consideration shows low                         volatility over the time period for which it has been observed.	1
         As an example, to quantify a category A MoC, institutions could:	              i.      calculate the average of the observed realisation of the parameter or risk driver                       under consideration for the period identified in accordance with                       paragraph 32(b)(ii);	1

14. In addition to paragraph 13, for the purpose of quantifying downturn LGD institutions         should apply the following requirements specific to downturn LGD estimates by facility         grade or pool:	(a) calibrate downturn LGD at least at the same level at which institutions calculate                   the corresponding long-run average LGD for the purpose of calibrating LGD in                   accordance with paragraph 161 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation].	1
(a) calibrate downturn LGD at least at the same level at which institutions calculate                   the corresponding long-run average LGD for the purpose of calibrating LGD in                   accordance with paragraph 161 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation].	(b) split the set of facilities covered by the same LGD model into as many different                   calibration segments as needed where each calibration segment carries a                   significantly different loss profile and might thus be affected differently by different                   downturn periods; for this purpose, institutions should at least consider the                   appropriateness of introducing calibration segments that cover material shares of                   exposure in different geographical areas, in different industry sectors and, for retail                   exposures, of different product types;	1
15. Where institutions identify multiple downturn periods in accordance with the final draft         RTS on economic downturn submitted by EBA [RTS on economic downturn],	(a) they should perform each of the steps in the following sequence:	1
(a) they should perform each of the steps in the following sequence:	(i) calibrate downturn LGD for each identified downturn period in accordance with                      Section 4.3 for each calibration segment;	1
(i) calibrate downturn LGD for each identified downturn period in accordance with                      Section 4.3 for each calibration segment;	(ii) for each of those downturn periods, apply the resulting downturn LGD estimates                      to their current non-defaulted exposures of the type of exposures under                      consideration and at the time of calibration;	1
(ii) for each of those downturn periods, apply the resulting downturn LGD estimates                      to their current non-defaulted exposures of the type of exposures under                      consideration and at the time of calibration;	(iii) choose the period as finally relevant downturn period that results in the highest                      average downturn LGD, including final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the                      [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], on a considered calibration segment of their                      current non-defaulted exposures as referred to in (ii). Institutions should then                      use the resulting downturn LGDs based on the finally relevant downturn period                      for each calibration segment to comply with paragraph 181 (b) CRR.	1
(iii) choose the period as finally relevant downturn period that results in the highest                      average downturn LGD, including final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the                      [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], on a considered calibration segment of their                      current non-defaulted exposures as referred to in (ii). Institutions should then                      use the resulting downturn LGDs based on the finally relevant downturn period                      for each calibration segment to comply with paragraph 181 (b) CRR.	(iv) in case that institutions can calibrate downturn LGD in accordance with Section	1
    17. For models with risk drivers sensitive to the economic cycle, institutions should ensure that         the resulting downturn LGD estimates are not unduly sensitive to changes in economic         cycle. For this purpose, institutions should do all of the following:	(a) analyse the difference between the distribution of exposures over facility grades                  or pools, or over appropriate intervals in case of continuous facility scales, of the                  current portfolio and the likely distribution of the current portfolio impacted by the                  relevant downturn period selected in accordance with paragraph 15,	1
(a) analyse the difference between the distribution of exposures over facility grades                  or pools, or over appropriate intervals in case of continuous facility scales, of the                  current portfolio and the likely distribution of the current portfolio impacted by the                  relevant downturn period selected in accordance with paragraph 15,	(b) if there is a substantial difference as a result of the analysis in (a), institutions                  should apply an adjustment to their downturn LGD estimates to limit the capital                  impact of an economic downturn in accordance with Article 181(1)(b) of Regulation                  (EU) No 575/2013.	1
    19. When comparing the final downturn LGD with the reference value in line with paragraph         18, institutions should take into account all of the following:	(a) A material difference between the final downturn LGD plus final MoC as set out in                  paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation](s) and the reference value                  can be justified if the period of losses identified by the reference value does not                  stem from a - potentially unidentified - downturn period or if the difference is due                  to the minimum MoC requirement in paragraph 36(b) where the downturn LGD is                  based on the methodology in Section 7. In case that the underlying downturn LGD                  is based on the methodology in Section 5, institutions may use the evidence                  gathered from the impact assessment in paragraph 27.	1
(a) A material difference between the final downturn LGD plus final MoC as set out in                  paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation](s) and the reference value                  can be justified if the period of losses identified by the reference value does not                  stem from a - potentially unidentified - downturn period or if the difference is due                  to the minimum MoC requirement in paragraph 36(b) where the downturn LGD is                  based on the methodology in Section 7. In case that the underlying downturn LGD                  is based on the methodology in Section 5, institutions may use the evidence                  gathered from the impact assessment in paragraph 27.	(b) If the material difference between the final downturn LGD and the reference value                  cannot be justified, institutions should re-assess their quantification of downturn                  LGD ensuring in particular that the downturn periods have been identified                  comprehensively and that, where intermediate parameters are used, the impact of                  the relevant downturn period observed (based on Section 5) or estimated (based                  on Section 6) on intermediate parameters has been aggregated adequately. After                  the institution has re-assessed its quantification of downturn LGD, and the                  methodology is assessed to be adequate, a material difference from the reference                  value can be explained.	1
21. For downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposures for the downturn period referred to         in paragraph 20, institutions should comply with all of the following:	(a) The downturn component of LGD estimation for defaulted exposures as referred to in              paragraph 193(b)(i) of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] should be quantified by              either:	1
(a) The downturn component of LGD estimation for defaulted exposures as referred to in              paragraph 193(b)(i) of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] should be quantified by              either:	(i) calibrating downturn LGD for the defaulted exposures under consideration for each                  reference date in accordance with Section 4.3 by inferring the downturn                  component of the LGD in default for each reference date based on the difference                  between the downturn LGD estimates and ELBE; or	1
(i) calibrating downturn LGD for the defaulted exposures under consideration for each                  reference date in accordance with Section 4.3 by inferring the downturn                  component of the LGD in default for each reference date based on the difference                  between the downturn LGD estimates and ELBE; or	(ii) first calibrating downturn LGD in accordance with Section 4.3 for the defaulted                  exposures under consideration for the moment of default and subsequently                  inferring the downturn component of the LGD in default at other reference dates	1
                based on the difference between the downturn LGD estimates at the moment of                 default and ELBE at the moment of default.	(b) In order to comply with paragraph 21(a)(ii), institutions may use the downturn             component of the LGD estimates for non-defaulted exposures instead of the downturn             component for defaulted exposures at the moment of default where the institution can             provide evidence that this results in more conservative estimates.	1
(b) In order to comply with paragraph 21(a)(ii), institutions may use the downturn             component of the LGD estimates for non-defaulted exposures instead of the downturn             component for defaulted exposures at the moment of default where the institution can             provide evidence that this results in more conservative estimates.	(c) In order to comply with paragraph 21(b) and where institutions use separate             estimation methodologies for long-run average and downturn LGD in accordance with             paragraph 16(a), the downturn component of the LGD estimates for non-defaulted             exposures may be inferred by considering the difference between the resulting             downturn LGD estimates and the corresponding long-run average LGDs taking into             account paragraph 193 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation].	1
26. Regardless of the approach used for calibrating downturn LGD institutions should adhere         to the following principles	             (a) where the approach used involves the estimation or analysis of different                  intermediate parameters, the aggregation of these intermediate parameters for                  the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD should start with the parameter where                  the highest impact is observed in accordance with paragraph 27 or estimated in	1
                 accordance with paragraph 30 and any additional impact observed or estimated on                  other parameters should be added where necessary.	             (b) The downturn LGD estimates should not be biased by observed or estimated cash                  flows that are received with a significantly longer time lag than the period referred                  to in paragraph 156 of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and which might rather                  reflect an upturn or improved economic conditions following the considered                  downturn period.	1
27. In order to calibrate downturn LGD based on the observed impact of a considered         downturn period, institutions should carry out an analysis of the impact of this downturn         period on the loss data related to the considered calibration segment.	(a) The analysis shall comprise at a minimum all of the following:	1
(a) The analysis shall comprise at a minimum all of the following:	(i) evidence of elevated levels of realised LGDs, driven by the considered downturn                  period taking into account all of the following:	1
(i) evidence of elevated levels of realised LGDs, driven by the considered downturn                  period taking into account all of the following:	(1) the realised LGDs should be calculated as averages related to all defaults that                        occurred in a considered year and that have either reached their maximum                        time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD                        estimation] or have been closed before;                    (2) for all incomplete recovery processes of defaulted exposures that have not                        reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156                        [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], the marginal recoveries reached in each                        year after default should be computed. The resulting recovery patterns should                        be compared to the recovery patterns of the defaults considered in letter (1)                        for each year in which the defaults occurred.	1
(1) the realised LGDs should be calculated as averages related to all defaults that                        occurred in a considered year and that have either reached their maximum                        time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD                        estimation] or have been closed before;                    (2) for all incomplete recovery processes of defaulted exposures that have not                        reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156                        [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], the marginal recoveries reached in each                        year after default should be computed. The resulting recovery patterns should                        be compared to the recovery patterns of the defaults considered in letter (1)                        for each year in which the defaults occurred.	(ii) evidence of decreased annual recoveries by sources of recoveries that are relevant                  for the considered calibration segment. These annual recoveries should be                  analysed with and without repossessions where applicable and irrespective of the                  date of default;	1
(ii) evidence of decreased annual recoveries by sources of recoveries that are relevant                  for the considered calibration segment. These annual recoveries should be                  analysed with and without repossessions where applicable and irrespective of the                  date of default;	(iii) evidence of decreased numbers of exposures that defaulted and returned back to                  the non-defaulted status within a predefined fixed horizons for all defaults that                  happened in a considered year in accordance with Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU)                  No 575/2013; The predefined fixed horizon should be appropriate for the type of                  exposure under consideration.	1
(iii) evidence of decreased numbers of exposures that defaulted and returned back to                  the non-defaulted status within a predefined fixed horizons for all defaults that                  happened in a considered year in accordance with Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU)                  No 575/2013; The predefined fixed horizon should be appropriate for the type of                  exposure under consideration.	(iv) evidence of increased time in default per year related to all defaults in a considered                  year.	1
                                                                                                   46 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN	        (b) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) shall take into account as many points in time             as possible where sufficient relevant loss data is available. Otherwise, if only scarce             relevant loss data is available on an annual basis, institutions should merge consecutive             years of observations as long as deemed of added value for the analysis.	1
        (b) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) shall take into account as many points in time             as possible where sufficient relevant loss data is available. Otherwise, if only scarce             relevant loss data is available on an annual basis, institutions should merge consecutive             years of observations as long as deemed of added value for the analysis.	(c) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) and (b), shall take into account any lag             between a downturn period and the time when its potential impact is observed on the             relevant loss data.	1
    29. Where the impact analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph 27 shows no impact of         a downturn period on an institution’s relevant loss data, such that the average observed         realised losses in this downturn period are not different from those under other economic         conditions, the institution may use the long-run average LGD as downturn LGD, where all         of the following applies:	(a) the institution ensures and documents that the deficiencies identified and MoC applied             in accordance with Section 4.4 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] incorporate             all additional elements of uncertainty related to the identified downturn periods;	1
(a) the institution ensures and documents that the deficiencies identified and MoC applied             in accordance with Section 4.4 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] incorporate             all additional elements of uncertainty related to the identified downturn periods;	(b) for the purpose of letter (a), the institution should in particular verify that, for the             considered downturn period, none of the deficiencies identified under the Category A,             MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are of             higher severity and that no additional deficiencies or adjustments under the Category             B MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are             applicable.	1
30. Where paragraph 24 applies, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD using one of the         methodologies specified in paragraph 31 (‘haircut approach’) and paragraph 32         (‘extrapolation approach’) or a combination of those. Prior to quantifying its downturn LGD         estimates, institutions should choose the most relevant methodology based on:	(a) the appropriateness of the methodology to estimate the impact of the downturn                 period under consideration on a realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk                 drivers;	1
(a) the appropriateness of the methodology to estimate the impact of the downturn                 period under consideration on a realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk                 drivers;	(b) where relevant, the need to use a combination of the methodologies to ensure                 that the resulting downturn LGDs for the downturn period under consideration                 adequately reflect a potential downturn impact on all material components of	1
32. (‘Extrapolation Approach’) For the purposes of these guidelines, an ‘extrapolation         approach’ refers to the estimation of the impact of the downturn period under         consideration on LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers if all of the following         conditions are met:	(a) where a statistically significant dependency between the realised LGDs,                  intermediate parameters or risk drivers, averaged over appropriate periods in time,                  and the economic factors selected in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation xx/xxx                  [RTS on economic downturn] which are relevant for the downturn period under                  consideration, can be established the resulting estimates are based on the                  extrapolated values of the average realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk                  drivers to the period reflecting the impact of the downturn period;	1
(a) where a statistically significant dependency between the realised LGDs,                  intermediate parameters or risk drivers, averaged over appropriate periods in time,                  and the economic factors selected in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation xx/xxx                  [RTS on economic downturn] which are relevant for the downturn period under                  consideration, can be established the resulting estimates are based on the                  extrapolated values of the average realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk                  drivers to the period reflecting the impact of the downturn period;	(b) where no statistically significant dependency as described in paragraph 32(a) can                  be established for an intermediate parameter or risk driver, institutions may                  estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on an                  intermediate parameter or risk driver based on observed data from a different                  period, where all of following three conditions are met:	1
(b) where no statistically significant dependency as described in paragraph 32(a) can                  be established for an intermediate parameter or risk driver, institutions may                  estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on an                  intermediate parameter or risk driver based on observed data from a different                  period, where all of following three conditions are met:	(i)   at least those components of economic loss that explain the major share                             of the total economic loss should be estimated by either a haircut                             approach in accordance with paragraph 31 or an extrapolation approach                             in accordance with paragraph 32(a);	1
(i)   at least those components of economic loss that explain the major share                             of the total economic loss should be estimated by either a haircut                             approach in accordance with paragraph 31 or an extrapolation approach                             in accordance with paragraph 32(a);	(ii)   the institution has observed data for the intermediate parameter or risk                             driver for a sufficient period of time which is at least as long as the period                             referred to in Article 181(1)(j) or Article 181(2), last subparagraph of                             Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; this period of time should include a period	1
                           where the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn                            period show values representing adverse economic conditions.	(iii)  the intermediate parameter or risk driver under consideration shows                            low volatility in the periods referred to in sub point (ii).	1
35. To reflect the lack of sufficient loss data, institutions should quantify a strictly positive         Category A MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a)(xi) of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD         estimation] for all approaches in this section. In particular, institutions applying an         extrapolation approach:	(a) as referred to in paragraph 32(a), should quantify the Category A MoC by using an                 appropriate confidence interval to reflect the uncertainty related to the statistical                 model used to describe the dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate                 parameters or risk drivers and the relevant economic factors;	1
(a) as referred to in paragraph 32(a), should quantify the Category A MoC by using an                 appropriate confidence interval to reflect the uncertainty related to the statistical                 model used to describe the dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate                 parameters or risk drivers and the relevant economic factors;	(b) for an intermediate parameter or risk driver as referred to in paragraph 32(b),                 should quantify the Category A MoC taking into account the ratio of the value(s) of                 the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period identified in                 accordance with Article 3 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] and                 value(s) of the relevant economic factor(s) observed in the periods referred to in                 paragraph 32(b)(ii);	1
        should quantify downturn LGD through any other approach subject to the following         conditions:	(a) they should ensure that the appropriate MoC required to be applied in accordance                 with Section 4.4.3 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] includes a Category A                 MoC that is strictly positive to account for the missing data;	1
(a) they should ensure that the appropriate MoC required to be applied in accordance                 with Section 4.4.3 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] includes a Category A                 MoC that is strictly positive to account for the missing data;	(b) they should ensure that the resulting downturn LGD estimates including the final                 MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], for the                 considered downturn period are higher or equal to the minimum between                        the according long-run average LGDs plus an add-on of 15 percentage                         points and                        105%;         Moreover, they should provide justification to the satisfaction of the competent authority         that they cannot calibrate downturn LGD appropriate for the considered downturn period         by applying any of the approaches set out in Section 5 and Section 6 of these guidelines.	1
37. Institutions should calculate a reference value in accordance with the following sequence         of steps:	(a) Using all available loss data, institutions should select the two individual years with                the highest observed economic loss by:	1
(a) Using all available loss data, institutions should select the two individual years with                the highest observed economic loss by:	                    (i) grouping all defaults according to the year in which the defaults occurred;	1
                    (i) grouping all defaults according to the year in which the defaults occurred;	                   (ii) for each year as identified in (i) calculating for the defaults that occurred in                         the considered year the ratio of total economic loss as specified in Section	1
6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] to the total outstanding                         amount of the according credit obligations at the moment of default;	                   (iii) selecting the two individual years with the highest annual ratio of total                          economic loss to total outstanding amount resulting from (ii) as the two                          individual years with the highest observed economic losses.	1
                   (iii) selecting the two individual years with the highest annual ratio of total                          economic loss to total outstanding amount resulting from (ii) as the two                          individual years with the highest observed economic losses.	           (b) Institutions should calculate the reference value(s) at least for each calibration                segment as the simple average of the average realised LGDs from the two individual                years with the highest observed economic losses, as identified in paragraph 37(a)(iii).	1
                                                                                                                       51 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN	        Finally, if no such data are available and the limited set of methodologies cannot be applied          either, the institution still has to provide downturn LGD estimates (as this is a CRR          requirement) but needs to include a margin of conservatism, covering for the lack of data          and methodological deficiencies. Under this third and final approach, it is required that the          final downturn LGD estimates include an appropriate margin of conservatism and be higher          than the corresponding long-run-average LGD estimates plus 15% (capped at a final          downturn LGD estimate of 105%).	1
The proposed text is a compromise between the different options:	       The impact assessment considers different groupings, depending on the aspect component         considered.	1
                                                                                                  60 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN	       Flexibility is left with regard to the estimation of the downturn LGD as long as it is coherent         with the results obtained in the impact assessment. However, the final GL contain some         principles in paragraph 26 which will support an appropriate aggregation of the results of         the impact assessment.	1

With respect to creditors and credit intermediaries referred to in             the definition of ‘Institutions’ in paragraph 17 which are not credit institutions,             payment institutions or electronic money institutions as referred to in that definition,             the Guidelines apply to the extent that those authorities have been designated as	1
             competent for ensuring the application and enforcement of the provisions of              Directive 2014/17/EU to which these Guidelines relate; and	         b. financial institutions as defined in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.	1

MiFID2 remuneration rules, including future delegated acts setting further specifications in relation to Articles 16(3) and 24(10) of MiFID2, will apply to structured deposits and, therefore, these Guidelines will not apply to them. 14   Directive 2014/49/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on deposit guarantee schemes (OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p.149). 15   Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC (OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p.338). 16    Different management body structures can be observed in European countries.

            a.    solely link remuneration to a quantitative target for the offer or provision of                   banking products and services; or	            b.    promote the offer or provision of a specific product or category of products over                   other products, such as products which are more profitable for the institutions or                   for a relevant person, to the detriment of the consumer.	1
2.1.   Institutions should document remuneration policies and practices, keep them for audit        purposes for at least five years from the last date that they applied, and make them        available to the competent authorities upon request. This documentation should include,        but is not limited to:	             a)        the objectives of the institutions’ remuneration policies and practices;	1

Institutions with a high level of IRRBB that could, under a plausible range of market         scenarios, result in losses, in curtailing normal dividend distribution, or in a decrease in         business operations should ensure that they have sufficient capital to withstand the         adverse impact of these scenarios.	1
40.In view of having internal governance arrangements pursuant to Article 74 and 88 of    Directive 2013/36/EU, institutions should, in relation to IRRBB, ensure the following:	    (a) That their management body bears the ultimate responsibility for the oversight of the         IRRBB management framework, the institution’s risk appetite framework and the amounts,         types and distribution of internal capital to adequately cover the risks. The management         body should determine the institution’s overall IRRBB strategy and approve the         corresponding policies and processes. The management body may, however, delegate the         monitoring and management of IRRBB to senior management, expert individuals or an         asset and liability management committee under the conditions further specified in         paragraph 41.	1

    (f) Understanding and assessing the functioning of its delegates in monitoring and controlling         IRRBB, consistent with policies approved by the management body, on the basis of regular         reviews of timely and sufficiently detailed information.	    (g) Understanding the implications of the institution’s IRRBB strategies and their potential         linkages with market, liquidity, credit and operational risk but without requiring all the         management body members to be experts in the area. Some of the members should have         sufficient technical knowledge to question and challenge the reports made to the         management body. The institution should establish that management body members are	1
42.Institutions should have delegation arrangements and procedures in place for any delegation by    the management body of the monitoring or management of IRRBB, including, but not limited    to, the following:	    (a) Persons or committees to which tasks of the management body are delegated for         developing IRRBB policies and practices, such as senior management, expert individuals or         an asset and liability management committee (ALCO), should be identified and have         objectives clearly set out by the management body.	1
    (a) Persons or committees to which tasks of the management body are delegated for         developing IRRBB policies and practices, such as senior management, expert individuals or         an asset and liability management committee (ALCO), should be identified and have         objectives clearly set out by the management body.	    (b) The management body should ensure that there is an adequate separation of         responsibilities in the risk management process for IRRBB. The IRRBB identification,         measurement, monitoring and control functions should have clearly defined         responsibilities, should be independent from risk-taking functions on IRRBB and should         report IRRBB exposures directly to the management body or its delegates.	1

(c) The institution should ensure that the management body’s delegates have clear lines of         authority over the units responsible for risk taking on IRRBB. The communication channel         to convey the delegates’ directives to these line units should be clear.	1
    (c) The institution should ensure that the management body’s delegates have clear lines of         authority over the units responsible for risk taking on IRRBB. The communication channel         to convey the delegates’ directives to these line units should be clear.	    (d) The management body should establish that the institution’s structure enables its         delegates to carry out their responsibilities, and facilitates effective decision-making and         governance. In this regard, an ALCO should meet regularly and its composition should         reflect each major department linked to IRRBB. The management body should foster         discussion regarding the IRRBB management process, both between its members and its         delegates and between its delegates and others in the institution. The management body         should also ensure that regular communication between the risk management and         strategic planning areas facilitate the monitoring of the risk arising from future business.	1
43.Institutions should articulate their risk appetite for IRRBB in terms of the risk to both economic    value and earnings in particular:	    (a) Institutions should have clearly defined risk appetite statements that are approved by their         management body and implemented through comprehensive risk appetite frameworks,	1
    (a) Institutions should have clearly defined risk appetite statements that are approved by their         management body and implemented through comprehensive risk appetite frameworks,	i.e. policies and procedures for limiting and controlling IRRBB.	1
i.e. policies and procedures for limiting and controlling IRRBB.	    (b) Their risk appetite frameworks should delineate delegated powers, lines of responsibility         and accountability over IRRBB management decisions and should list the instruments,         hedging strategies and risk-taking opportunities authorised for IRRBB.	1
                                                                                                  14 GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES	    (c) In defining their risk appetites, institutions should take account of earnings risks that may         arise as a consequence of the accounting treatment of transactions in the non-trading         book. The risk to earnings may not be limited to interest income and expenses: the effects         of changes in interest rates on the market value of instruments that, depending on         accounting treatment, are reflected either through the profit and loss account or directly         in equity (via other comprehensive income), should be taken into account separately.         Institutions should particularly take into account the earnings impact related to embedded         optionalities in fair value instruments under ongoing interest rate shocks and stress         scenarios. Institutions should also take into account the potential impact on the P&L         accounts of hedging interest rate derivatives if their effectiveness was hampered by         interest rate changes.	1
44.Institutions should implement limits that target maintaining IRRBB exposures consistent with    their risk appetite and with their overall approach for measuring IRRBB, in particular the    following:	    (a) Aggregate risk limits that clearly articulate the amount of IRRBB acceptable to the         management body should be applied on a consolidated basis and, as appropriate, at the         level of individual affiliates.	1
    (a) Aggregate risk limits that clearly articulate the amount of IRRBB acceptable to the         management body should be applied on a consolidated basis and, as appropriate, at the         level of individual affiliates.	    (b) Limits may be associated with specific scenarios of changes in interest rates and term         structures, such as their increase or decrease or a change in shape of the yield curve. The         interest rate movements used in developing these limits should represent sufficiently         adverse shock and stress situations, taking into account historical interest rate volatility and         the time required by management to mitigate those risk exposures.	1

(c) Policy limits should be appropriate to the nature, size, complexity and capital adequacy of         the institution, as well as its ability to measure and manage its risks.	1
    (c) Policy limits should be appropriate to the nature, size, complexity and capital adequacy of         the institution, as well as its ability to measure and manage its risks.	    (d) Depending on the nature of an institution's activities and business model, sub-limits may         also be identified for individual business units, portfolios, instrument types, specific         instruments or material sub-types of IRRBB risk such as gap risk, basis risk and option risk.	1
    (d) Depending on the nature of an institution's activities and business model, sub-limits may         also be identified for individual business units, portfolios, instrument types, specific         instruments or material sub-types of IRRBB risk such as gap risk, basis risk and option risk.	    (e) Systems should be in place to ensure that positions that exceed, or are likely to exceed,         limits defined by the management body or its delegates receive prompt management         attention and are escalated without delay. There should be a clear policy on who will be         informed, how the communication will take place and the actions which will be taken in         response.	1

There should be a clear policy on who will be         informed, how the communication will take place and the actions which will be taken in         response.	    (f) The reporting of risk measures to the management body or its delegates should have at         least a quarterly frequency and should compare current exposure with policy limits.	1
46.The management body should, based on its overall IRRBB strategy, adopt robust risk policies,    processes and systems which should ensure that:	     (a) procedures for updating scenarios for the measurement and assessment of IRRBB are set          up;	1
     (a) procedures for updating scenarios for the measurement and assessment of IRRBB are set          up;	     (b) the measurement approach and the corresponding assumptions for measuring and          assessing IRRBB, including the allocation of internal capital to IRRBB risks, are appropriate          and proportional;	1
     (b) the measurement approach and the corresponding assumptions for measuring and          assessing IRRBB, including the allocation of internal capital to IRRBB risks, are appropriate          and proportional;	     (c) the assumptions of the models used are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, amended;	1
     (c) the assumptions of the models used are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, amended;	     (d) standards for the evaluation of positions and the measuring of performance are defined;	1
     (d) standards for the evaluation of positions and the measuring of performance are defined;	     (e) appropriate documentation and control over permissible hedging strategies and hedging          instruments exist; and	1
     (e) appropriate documentation and control over permissible hedging strategies and hedging          instruments exist; and	     (f) the lines of authority and responsibility for managing IRRBB exposures are defined.	1
47.The policies should be well reasoned, robust and documented and should address all IRRBB    components that are important to the institution’s individual circumstances. Without prejudice    to the proportionality principle, the IRRBB policies should include the following:	     (a) The application of the boundary between ‘non-trading book’ and ‘trading book’. Internal          risk transfers between the banking book and the trading book should be properly          documented and monitored within the broader monitoring of the IRRBB originated by          interest rate derivatives instruments.	1

71.Institutions should ensure that the validation of IRRBB measurement methods — which should    be reviewed and validated independently of their development — and the assessment of    corresponding model risk are included in a formal policy process that should be reviewed and    approved by the management body or its delegates. The policy should be integrated within the    governance processes for model risk management and should specify:	           (a) the management roles and designate who is responsible for the development,                validation, documentation, implementation and use of models; and	1

In assessing the implications of optionality, institutions should take into account:	    (a) The potential impact on current and future loan prepayment speeds arising from the         interest rate scenario, underlying economic environment and contractual features.         Institutions should take into account the various dimensions influencing the embedded         behavioural options.	1

108. In making behavioural assumptions about accounts without specific repricing dates for the    purposes of interest rate risk management, institutions should:	    (a) Be able to identify ‘core’ balances, i.e. deposits that are stable and unlikely to reprice even         under significant changes in interest rate environment, and/or other deposits whose         limited elasticity to interest rate changes could be modelled by banks.	1

115. When calculating the change in EVE for the purpose of paragraphs 113 and 114, institutions    should in particular apply the following principles:	         (a) All positions from interest rate sensitive instruments should be taken into account.	1
         (a) All positions from interest rate sensitive instruments should be taken into account.	         (b) Small trading book business should be included unless its interest rate risk is captured              in another risk measure.	1

(i) The treatment of commercial margins and other spread components in interest              payments in terms of their exclusion from or inclusion in the cash flows should be in              accordance with the institutions’ internal management and measurement approach for              interest rate risk in the non-trading book. Institutions should notify the competent              authority whether they exclude commercial margins and other spread components              from the calculation or not. If commercial margins and other spread components are              excluded, institutions should (i) use a transparent methodology for identifying the riskfree rate at inception of each instrument; (ii) use a methodology that is applied              consistently across business units; and (iii) ensure that the exclusion of commercial              margins and other spread components from the cash flows is consistent with how the              institution manages and hedges IRRBB.	1

(o) The assumed behavioural repricing date for retail and non-financial wholesale deposits              without any specific repricing dates (non-maturity deposits) should be constrained to              a maximum average of 5 years. The 5-year cap applies individually for each currency.              Non-maturity deposits from financial institutions should not be subject to behavioural              modelling.	1
Two approaches are proposed in these draft Guidelines to correct the MD calculation:	      i.    Treat the debt instrument with prepayment risk as if it was really a combination of a             plain vanilla bond and an embedded option. Correct the Modified Duration of the plain             vanilla bond with the change in value of the embedded option, estimated according to             its theoretical delta, resulting from a 100 basis points (b.p.) movement in interest             rates.	1

Alternatively, calculate directly the change in value of the whole instrument subject to             prepayment risk resulting from a 100 b.p. movement in interest rates.	1
Additionally, the guidelines request to compute the following elements to the correction:	      i.    Under the first approach, the theoretical delta of the embedded option will either             overestimate or underestimate the correction that should be applied to the MD. To             avoid this, the positive or negative effect of the convexity stemming from the             embedded option should be computed. Under the second approach it is not necessary             to correct convexity, since its effect would already be included in the repricing of the             instrument.	1
      i.    Under the first approach, the theoretical delta of the embedded option will either             overestimate or underestimate the correction that should be applied to the MD.

Under both approaches it is requested that the effect of transaction costs and             behavioural factors are also reflected (where these are sufficiently relevant) in the             correction. The guidelines request the consideration of these factors to reflect the fact             that some of the options’ buyers, in particular retail clients, might decide not to             execute the option despite being in the money.	1
The complexity of the embedded prepayment optionality varies, however it generally has the following features:	     Its value will be a factor of the shape of the yield curve and its dynamics, which                   represent the optionality nature of the callable/puttable feature.	1
                                                                                                                              8 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CORRECTIONS TO MODIFIED DURATION	             It usually has multiple exercise dates, which are represented by a Bermudan feature.	1
             It usually has multiple exercise dates, which are represented by a Bermudan feature.	     Normally, the premium for the embedded optionality sold by the investor is               incorporated in the bond by way of a higher coupon, relative to comparable noncallable transaction, and/or lower value.	1
     Normally, the premium for the embedded optionality sold by the investor is               incorporated in the bond by way of a higher coupon, relative to comparable noncallable transaction, and/or lower value.	     The optionality embedded in the instrument biases or reverses the classical convex               relationship between price and yield of long bond positions; the same effect can be               observed for the negative convexity stemming from short positions.	1
The guidelines use the following formula for the CMD:	              -        Since the value of the instrument is equal to the value of the vanilla bond                        instrument, plus or minus (depending on whether the institution has bought or sold                        the option) the value of the embedded option, the CMD is approximated as the                        difference of the Modified Duration of the vanilla instrument and the first order                        approximation of the change in value of the option due to the change in the                        underlying value (i.e. equivalent to the delta) of the option embedded, adjusted by                        the current price of the bond.	1
              -        Since the value of the instrument is equal to the value of the vanilla bond                        instrument, plus or minus (depending on whether the institution has bought or sold                        the option) the value of the embedded option, the CMD is approximated as the                        difference of the Modified Duration of the vanilla instrument and the first order                        approximation of the change in value of the option due to the change in the                        underlying value (i.e. equivalent to the delta) of the option embedded, adjusted by                        the current price of the bond.	              -        As previously mentioned the negative or positive gamma introduced by the                        embedded optionality should be factored, adjusted by the price of the bond and the                        change in value of the interest rate and divided by two (i.e. in consistency with                        Taylor series approximation).	1
              -        As previously mentioned the negative or positive gamma introduced by the                        embedded optionality should be factored, adjusted by the price of the bond and the                        change in value of the interest rate and divided by two (i.e. in consistency with                        Taylor series approximation).	              -        Apart from the previous adjustments, the guidelines request that an additional                        correction factor is considered in order to reflect any significant transaction costs                        that the early payment of the callable bond might produce, as well as behavioural                        factors, which would reflect the fact that some of the options’ buyers might decide                        not to execute the option despite being in the money. This additional correction                        shall be either considered in the delta / gamma calculations or, alternatively, treated                        as a separate factor.                                                                                  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 × Φ × Ω	1
Finally, ‘behavioural’ factors shall be introduced to reflect the fact that some clients, in particular retail ones, may not always exercise the option, even when it is in the money. These behavioural factors should only be considered where they are significant. In this regard, it is understood that for a majority of banks very few, if any, of the hybrid instruments booked in the trading book will be held by retail clients; however, in some jurisdictions, retail clients do hold these kinds of hybrid positions. Where relevant, these behavioural factors may be explained by some known elements, such as:	          -     Size of the principal outstanding compared with initial lending: when the remaining                 principal is close to the initial amount lent, borrowers tend to react faster to gains                 from prepayment. These ‘aggressive’ borrowers tend to leave (or refinance) at an                 early stage. Conversely, as time goes by, the remaining borrowers tend to be the                 most ‘rigid’ ones and are not likely to execute the embedded option.	1

9. For the purpose of these guidelines, the following definitions apply:	        (a) a callable bond is a type of debt instrument that gives the issuer of the bond the right,             but not the obligation, to redeem the bond at some point before it reaches its date of             maturity	1

11.For the purposes of the correction of the modified duration calculation for all debt instruments    subject to prepayment risk, referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 340(3) of    Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should apply one of the following:	   (a) the formula set out in paragraph 12;	1
   (a) the formula set out in paragraph 12;	   (b) the formula set out in paragraph 13.	1
15.For the purposes of assessing the additional factor Ψ in accordance with paragraph 13 of these    guidelines, institutions should take into account all of the following:	       a. that transaction costs reduce the value of the option, making the option unlikely to be           executed below the threshold established by the transaction costs;	1
       a. that transaction costs reduce the value of the option, making the option unlikely to be           executed below the threshold established by the transaction costs;	       b. that there are behavioural factors suggesting that some clients, in particular retail           clients, may not always exercise an option, despite it being in the money, due to some           known circumstances including the following:	1
       b. that there are behavioural factors suggesting that some clients, in particular retail           clients, may not always exercise an option, despite it being in the money, due to some           known circumstances including the following:	(i) where the remaining principal is close to the initial amount lent, leading some               ‘aggressive’ borrowers to leave or refinance at an early stage;	1
(i) where the remaining principal is close to the initial amount lent, leading some               ‘aggressive’ borrowers to leave or refinance at an early stage;	(ii) in the case of borrowers with the largest loan size who have the largest gain from               prepayment as the cost attached to prepayment is a fixed amount.	1
The major disadvantages of the inclusion of the gamma factor are:	           i)   It is more costly for banks to calculate the gamma factor. There are currently only a                 few banks (in Denmark) that have similar provisions that account for the                 prepayment risk. Therefore, calculating the gamma factor for a bond with an                 embedded option will increase costs for most of the banks in the EU.	1

However, the inclusion of the gamma factor is expected to have the following advantages:	           i)   It adjusts for convexity (for long positions) and concavity (for short positions), and                 provides a more accurate estimate to capture risk associated with the positions.

Convexity risk is accounted for in the calculation of own funds                  requirements.	1

‘Relevant DGSs’                             the DGSs in connection with which any of the following                                             situations occur:	                                            (i)     a branch of a home DGS’s member credit                                                     institution has been established in the territory of                                                     the Member State of the host DGS;	1
                                            (i)     a branch of a home DGS’s member credit                                                     institution has been established in the territory of                                                     the Member State of the host DGS;	                                            (ii)    a member credit institution affiliated to a DGS                                                     ceases to be a member of such DGS in order to                                                     join another DGS; or	1
                                            (ii)    a member credit institution affiliated to a DGS                                                     ceases to be a member of such DGS in order to                                                     join another DGS; or	                                            (iii)   the national legislation transposing the DGS                                                     Directive in the jurisdiction of a DGS lending the                                                     funds to another DGS allows for such a                                                     possibility.	1
13. In accordance with Article 14(5) of Directive 2014/49/EU, the objectives of the cooperation     agreements should be to:	    •   facilitate an effective cooperation between the DGSs, or, where appropriate, the         designated authorities; and	1
    •   facilitate an effective cooperation between the DGSs, or, where appropriate, the         designated authorities; and	    •   specify ex ante various aspects of depositor payouts, transfers of DGS contributions and         lending between DGSs which otherwise would have to be agreed upon very quickly at a         time of stress, which would divert the DGS’s attention and resources away from other         difficult decisions.	1
17. Pursuant to Article 14(5) of Directive 2014/49/EU, cooperation agreements should, at least,     cover the following three key areas:	      i.       modalities for repaying depositors by the host DGS at branches of credit institutions                authorised in other Member States pursuant to Article 14(2) of Directive 2014/49/EU;	1
      i.       modalities for repaying depositors by the host DGS at branches of credit institutions                authorised in other Member States pursuant to Article 14(2) of Directive 2014/49/EU;	     ii.       modalities for the transfer of contributions from one DGS to another in case a credit                institution ceases to be a member of a DGS and joins another DGS, including crossborder and domestic transfers, pursuant to Article 14(3) of Directive 2014/49/EU;	1
     ii.       modalities for the transfer of contributions from one DGS to another in case a credit                institution ceases to be a member of a DGS and joins another DGS, including crossborder and domestic transfers, pursuant to Article 14(3) of Directive 2014/49/EU;	     iii.      modalities for mutual lending between DGSs pursuant to Article 12 of                Directive 2014/49/EU.	1
25. The home DGS should obtain the SCV in line with domestic deadlines for receiving this     information from the credit institution. It should then process the SCV in order to provide the     host DGS with only the relevant instructions for payment in a format agreed between the     DGSs and specifying the amounts to be paid out in the currency agreed in the cooperation     agreements. The information to be transmitted from the home DGS to the host DGS should     include:	     •   the amount to be paid out to each depositor;	1
     •   the amount to be paid out to each depositor;	     •   all the information needed depending on the payout method (for example, addresses of          depositors or bank account numbers for electronic transfers).	1
         36. The host DGS should, within one working day, notify the home DGS of a depositor request for              a cost of living payout. This notification should include all relevant information, including:	                    a. the clear and complete identification of the depositor, including the relevant account                        details;	1
                    a. the clear and complete identification of the depositor, including the relevant account                        details;	                    b. the date of receiving the request by the host DGS;	1
                    b. the date of receiving the request by the host DGS;	                    c. the amount claimed (if applicable).	1
39. Cooperation agreements should outline the process for repaying temporary high balances by     the host DGS, which should happen in the following sequence:	        a. Depositors submit claims, either to host or home DGS.	1
        a. Depositors submit claims, either to host or home DGS.	        b. Where the claims are addressed to the host DGS, that DGS should forward the claim            to the home DGS.	1
        b. Where the claims are addressed to the host DGS, that DGS should forward the claim            to the home DGS.	        c. Where the claims are addressed to the home DGS, or the home DGS receives them            from the host DGS, the home DGS should verify the claims. The host DGS should lend            assistance where necessary, for example in dealing with the language or legal issues            stemming from the law applicable in the host DGS’s jurisdiction.	1
        c. Where the claims are addressed to the home DGS, or the home DGS receives them            from the host DGS, the home DGS should verify the claims. The host DGS should lend            assistance where necessary, for example in dealing with the language or legal issues            stemming from the law applicable in the host DGS’s jurisdiction.	        d. Upon verifying the claims, the home DGS should send the necessary information on            deposits, depositors and funds to the host DGS, either as a package with other claims            if done in a reasonable timeframe, or individually.	1
        d. Upon verifying the claims, the home DGS should send the necessary information on            deposits, depositors and funds to the host DGS, either as a package with other claims            if done in a reasonable timeframe, or individually.	        e. The host DGS should repay the depositors.	1
40. Supplementary bilateral or multilateral cooperation agreements should also specify the     following aspects:	        a. the home DGS’s deadline, if applicable, for accepting repayment claims from            depositors, which the host DGS should communicate to the relevant depositors;	1
        a. the home DGS’s deadline, if applicable, for accepting repayment claims from            depositors, which the host DGS should communicate to the relevant depositors;	        b. information on the home DGS’s temporary high balances repayment deadline and            coverage level.	1
        b. information on the home DGS’s temporary high balances repayment deadline and            coverage level.	f.      Currencies used	1
44. The necessary funding referred to in paragraphs 32–34 should be provided in the currency of     repayment determined under the law of the home DGS pursuant to paragraphs 41 and 42.     The home DGS should handle the necessary currency exchange and bear the necessary     currency exchange costs.	g.      Handling of correspondence and language used	1
                                                                                              12 GUIDELINES ON COOPERATION BETWEEN DEPOSIT GUARANTEE SCHEMES	h.      Reimbursement of costs of repayment	1
50. Cooperation agreements should specify the types of costs that the home DGS will reimburse     the host DGS for, including, but not limited to, costs incurred in performing the following     tasks attributable to the payout:	        a. communication with depositors, including setting up the necessary infrastructure,            hiring staff and media publications;	1
        a. communication with depositors, including setting up the necessary infrastructure,            hiring staff and media publications;	        b. communication with the home DGS, including providing feedback information about            claims paid;	1
        b. communication with the home DGS, including providing feedback information about            claims paid;	        c. collection of additional information needed for the payout, including setting up the            necessary infrastructure and hiring staff;	1
        c. collection of additional information needed for the payout, including setting up the            necessary infrastructure and hiring staff;	        d. translation of documents;	1
        d. translation of documents;	        e. acquisition of information;	1
        e. acquisition of information;	        f.   transaction costs of payouts;	1
        f.   transaction costs of payouts;	        g. relevant legal costs.	1
51. Eligible costs incurred by the host DGS should meet the following criteria:	        a. be necessary for carrying out the payout;	1
        a. be necessary for carrying out the payout;	        b. be actual, reasonable, justified and comply with the principle of sound financial            management;	1
        b. be actual, reasonable, justified and comply with the principle of sound financial            management;	        c. be identifiable, in particular, being recorded in the accounting records of the host DGS            and backed by effective supporting evidence.	1
52. Cooperation agreements may provide that:	        a. the home DGS shall provide a lump sum amount, based on estimates, ahead of the            host DGS incurring costs followed by reconciliation of accounts; or	1
        a. the home DGS shall provide a lump sum amount, based on estimates, ahead of the            host DGS incurring costs followed by reconciliation of accounts; or	        b. the host DGS shall be reimbursed for costs agreed upon in the cooperation            agreement following the payout.	1
63. The provision of accurate data is a key step in ensuring an effective transfer of information     from one DGS to another. Cooperation agreements should specify the deadline for the DGS     which the member credit institution is leaving (transferring DGS) to notify the DGS the     member credit institution in question wants to join (receiving DGS) about the intention of the     member credit institution to join the receiving DGS or, where a member credit institution     communicates to the receiving DGS its intention to become a member credit institution of     such DGS, to notify the transferring DGS of such circumstance. The deadline referred to above     should begin from the date on which:	        •    the member credit institution notifies the transferring DGS of its desire to join              another DGS, where the transferring DGS knows which DGS the institution intends to              join; or	1
        •    the member credit institution notifies the transferring DGS of its desire to join              another DGS, where the transferring DGS knows which DGS the institution intends to              join; or	        •    the member credit institution notifies the receiving DGS of its desire to join.	1
65. The information to be transmitted should include anything that the transferring DGS and the     receiving DGS jointly consider as relevant, including and where available:	       a. aggregate information on all the regular contributions (and related deposits) being           transferred from one DGS to the other DGS, including, where relevant, aggregate           information on deposit flows in the member credit institution for a period agreed to by           both DGSs;	1
       a. aggregate information on all the regular contributions (and related deposits) being           transferred from one DGS to the other DGS, including, where relevant, aggregate           information on deposit flows in the member credit institution for a period agreed to by           both DGSs;	       b. any audits, assessments and tests previously done on the capability of the institution           to produce SCV files and other information previously requested by the transferring           DGS, particularly on the quality of data provided by the member credit institution;	1
       b. any audits, assessments and tests previously done on the capability of the institution           to produce SCV files and other information previously requested by the transferring           DGS, particularly on the quality of data provided by the member credit institution;	       c. any other relevant information, including information on near misses related to that           member credit institution.	1
71. According to paragraph 13(d) of the EBA guidelines on payment commitments to deposit     guarantee schemes 5, where a credit institution ceases to be a member of one DGS and joins     another DGS, the transferring DGS should ensure that the financial means corresponding to     the 12 months preceding the end of the membership are transferred to the receiving DGS,     either by:	           •   enforcing the commitments and transferring the proceeds to the receiving DGS; or	1
           •   enforcing the commitments and transferring the proceeds to the receiving DGS; or	           •   reassigning the payment commitments arrangement to the receiving DGS in                agreement with the latter and the credit institution.	1
31. As a result, the EBA clarified in Guideline 3.1.c. that the information on whether or not the CA     has forwarded the complaint to another authority or body should also include the name and     contact details of that authority or body. The EBA also changed the wording of Guideline 6.1.b.,     which now requires CAs to also make publicly available information on how each channel for     submission of information will be accessed.

It is worth noting that, for the estimation of the impact of the contagion requirements, the QIS specified using the materiality threshold currently in use rather than the one prescribed in the RTS on the materiality threshold. Although there are clearly interactions between the two, these are intentionally not reflected here, in order to capture the pure impact of the proposed contagion rules. Table 7 in the QIS report shows a modest increase in default rate and decrease in LGD for the IRB institutions across all exposure classes under consideration. Although the qualitative section of the QIS shows a heterogeneous use of contagion rules among institutions the overall impact on capital is almost zero for both SA and IRB institutions.

The guidelines set out how competent authorities should apply the criteria in Article 3(2), which factors they should take into consideration, how they should report their list of the most representative services to the EBA and to the Commission, and what supporting data should be obtained.	In order to give effect to the mandate, the EBA is of the view that:	0
EBA REGULAR USE                                                                                      20 FINAL REPORT ON SPECIFICATION OF TYPES OF EXPOSURES TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH RISK UNDER ARTICLE 128(3) OF REGULATION (EU) NO 575/2013	ones provided by the Basel III framework and, in particular, with the speculative unlisted exposures and other subordinated debt, capital and equity exposures (paragraphs 50-53). In line with its prerogatives, the EBA has taken the initiative to provide, for the purposes of the present guidelines only, a definition of the notions of private equity and venture capital. This step has been taken precisely because of the lack of guidance available to the public on these notions and because the definitions are deemed necessary for providing guidance and ensuring harmonisation regarding the types of exposures that are considered as investments in venture capital and private equity. Furthermore, the EBA clarifies that the definitions apply to direct investments and whenever the look-through approach is used for exposures in the form of shares or units in CIUs, in line with the answer provided by the Commission to Q&A 2013_374.	0
   196. Credit institutions should ensure adequate rotation of appraisers, i.e. two sequential       individual valuations of the immovable property by the same appraiser should result in the       rotation of the appraiser, resulting in the appointment of either a different internal appraiser       or a different external appraisal provider.	                                                                                                   52 FINAL REPORT – GUIDELINES ON MANAGEMENT OF NON-PERFORMING AND FORBORNE EXPOSURES	0
The Guidelines also include three annexes. Annex I includes a list of categories of recovery plan indicators. Annex II specifies the minimum list of recovery plan indicators that should be included under the rebuttable presumption.

Nevertheless, the Basel Committee of Banking Supervisors (BCBS) notes that there exists potential for capital arbitrage within the credit risk mitigation framework, including use of credit risk mitigation for securitisation exposures, particularly when (i) there is a delay in recognising the cost of protection in earnings while (ii) the bank receives an immediate regulatory capital benefit in the form of a lower risk weight on an exposure on which it is nominally transferring risk. In such instances, there may be no meaningful transfer of credit risk.	While the arbitrage opportunities exist more generally under the credit risk mitigation framework, the arbitrage opportunities are more likely to occur when credit risk transfer techniques are used for securitisation transactions, where the difference in the risk weight before and after transferring credit risk can be very large.	0

Definition of technical past due situations	The concept of so-called ‘technical past due situations’, often called ‘technical defaults’, has not been specified in the CRR.

        remuneration policies 27 and Article 7 of Directive 2014/17/EU, 28 as well as for retail         exposures, those of the EBA Guidelines on remuneration policies and practices related to the         sale and provision of retail banking products and services.29 The appraisal system should be         mainly linked to the quantitative elements of the credit institution’s NPE targets but may also         include qualitative elements (level of technical abilities relating to the analysis of financial         information and data received, structuring of proposals, quality of recommendations or         monitoring of restructured cases, as well as effective negotiation skills). The performance of         the NPE WU staff should be regularly monitored and measured against these targets either         on an individual basis or at team level, as appropriate.	     82.The performance measurement framework for the management body and relevant         managers should include specific indicators linked to the targets defined in the credit         institution’s NPE strategy and operational plan. The weights given to these indicators within         the overall performance measurement framework should be proportionate to the severity         of the NPE issues faced by the credit institution.	0
Option c elaborates on the previous option by setting a cap of 20%, in line with the ITS on supervisory reporting. Under this option institutions specify the threshold for the pulling effect but these thresholds are be capped at 20%. If an institution decides to introduce a lower threshold, all defaulted exposures will be reported as non-performing. Also, the option allows the possibility of introducing stricter rules if this is justified by the observed historical data. A concern related to this option is that the cap may lead to an excessive number of zero-loss defaults.	Option d sets the threshold for the pulling effect at the 20% level. Although the option achieves full harmonisation and alignment with the supervisory framework, it lacks flexibility and leaves room for an excessive number of zero-loss defaults.	0

In Figure 6 we can observe the relationship gamma-yield of a vanilla bond, a puttable bond and a put on the vanilla bond. We note that the sensitivities of the bond are always positive, while the gamma sensitivities of the put option on the bond can be both positive and negative.	We can observe that the gamma sensitivities of the put on bond tend to be higher for values closer to the par value of the yield (6%). The gamma sensitivities of the option tends to zero the more we move far from the par yield, so gamma sensitivities for the vanilla bond and the puttable bond tend to converge for value of the yield far from the par yield.	0
   4.2.2          External conditions and operating environment	   33.Credit institutions should assess and consider the current and likely future external operating       conditions and environment when establishing the NPE strategy and associated NPE       reduction targets.

2.9.   In the case of a series of payment transactions being executed, or fraudulent payment        transactions being executed, the payment service provider should consider each payment        transaction or fraudulent payment transaction in the series to count as one.	2.10. The payment service provider can report zero (‘0’) where there were no transactions or       fraudulent transactions taking place for a particular indicator in the reporting period       established. Where the payment service provider cannot report data for a specific       breakdown because that particular data breakdown is not applicable to that PSP, the data       should be reported as ‘NA’.	0
      176. In accordance with the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting          for expected credit losses, credit institutions should have in place common processes,          systems, tools and data.	      177.

a) Overall IRRBB strategy	49. Based on the overarching business strategy, the management body should approve the overall     IRRBB strategy of the institution, including the acceptable level for IRRBB and IRRBB mitigation     (see also Principle 17 of EBA GL 44 on internal governance).	0
    36.As an exception, institutions may, for the purpose of estimating downturn LGD for defaulted        exposures for a specific reference date, build on the estimation of downturn LGD at the time        of default, if the institution can convincingly explain that this is a conservative estimate of        downturn LGD in default for the specific reference date. In this context, it should be noted that        the GL text in paragraph 21(b) refers to the downturn component for defaulted exposures at        the moment of default. This is relevant, as in the event of partial write-offs at the moment of        default the loss related to these write-offs will be relevant to the downturn LGD for nondefaulted exposure, but might not be taken into account for downturn LGD for defaulted        exposure at the moment of default where compliant with paragraph 179 of the GL on PD and        LGD estimation.	    37.The rationale for the exemption is that the LGD in default converges by construction to 100%        and therefore the additional amount that can be lost due to an economic downturn decreases        over time.	0
The so-called ‘pulling effect’, introduced in the ITS on supervisory reporting, is related to the threshold in terms of a percentage of the total credit obligations of an obligor that indicates when all exposures of an obligor should be considered non-performing. This means that for the purpose of supervisory reporting if 20% of exposures of one obligor are classified as non-performing all other exposures to this obligor should also be reported as non-performing.	As all defaulted exposures are required to be reported as non-performing the pulling effect is in practice only applicable to retail exposures where the definition of default is applied at the facility level. In all other cases, i.e. where the definition of default is applied at the obligor level, if one exposure is considered defaulted then all other exposures also have to be classified as defaulted and therefore all exposures of the obligor are classified as non-performing.	0
48. The home and the host DGSs or, where relevant, the designated authorities, should use     English to communicate with one another, unless they agree bilaterally to use another     language in their communication.	49. Communication channels established to communicate with the depositors, and between the     home and the host DGSs, should guarantee sufficient levels of confidentiality and security.	0
    2. Guidelines set out the EBA’s view of appropriate supervisory practices within the        European System of Financial Supervision or of how Union law should be applied in a        particular area. Competent authorities as defined in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU)        No 1093/2010 to whom guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them into their        practices as appropriate (e.g. by amending their legal framework or their supervisory        processes), including where guidelines are directed primarily at institutions.

19. In considering how to take proportionality or materiality into account in the design of an ECL     methodology or in its implementation, it is important to ensure that bias is not being     introduced.	20. The timely recognition of credit deterioration and allowances should not be delayed without     prejudice to the fact that ECL accounting frameworks are symmetrical in the way that     subsequent changes (both deteriorations and reversals of those deteriorations) in the credit     risk profile of a debtor should be considered in the measurement of the allowances.	0
The EBA’s view is that the best way of balancing these concerns is to combine the two approaches and introduce a general rule which would allow disclosure of confidential information in summary	                                                                                                     12 FINAL REPORT ON GL HOW INFORMATION SHOULD BE PROVIDED IN SUMMARY OR COLLECTIVE FORM	0

12.The principles and criteria for forming a group of connected clients are the same, irrespective of    whether the head of the group is a central government or not. Therefore, in general, institutions    have to assess the existence of a group of connected clients for the central government itself and    treat the whole set consisting of the central government and all of the natural or legal persons    directly or indirectly controlled by it in accordance with point (a) of Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation    (EU) No 575/2013, or interconnected with it in accordance with point (b) of that same Article, as    one single group of connected clients.	13.However, the last subparagraph of Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 permits    institutions to make use of a different approach in assessing the existence of a group of connected    clients separately for each of the persons directly controlled by or directly interconnected with    the central government (‘alternative approach’). The term ‘may’ makes it clear that using this    alternative approach is not mandatory but left to institutions’ discretion.	0
Addressees	8. These guidelines are addressed to competent authorities as defined in point (i) of Article 4(2) of    Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and to financial institutions as defined in Article 4(1) of Regulation    (EU) No 1093/2010.	0
2.2 Effect in capital of the correction to reflect prepayment risk It should be noted that the effect of any correction to the modified duration to reflect ‘prepayment risk’ will always be negative, i.e. the duration of a bond with embedded optionality will always be lower than (or, at a minimum for deep out of the money options, equal to) the one obtained for the plain vanilla bond. Regardless of its sign, the same thing could be said for a short position where the counterparty has the option to call for an early payment (e.g. a put bond, puttable bond or retractable bond).	Of course, since capital requirements under the standardised approach are higher for bonds with a longer maturity, the incorporation of the ‘prepayment risk’ would have the apparently paradoxical effect of reducing the capital requirement for the bond with embedded optionality, when compared to the same position without considering the optionality.	0
5. These Guidelines provide detail on statistical data on fraud related to different means of    payment that payment service providers have to report to their competent authorities, as well    as on the aggregated data that the competent authorities have to share with the EBA and the    ECB, in accordance with Article 96(6) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 (PSD2).	Scope of application	0
In many of their comments respondents requested additional clarifications on the proposed rules. This related in particular to the application of the default definition to factoring exposures, where many additional provisions have been added to the guidelines in order to provide greater clarity.	Finally, many respondents indicated that the implementation of the guidelines may be burdensome and, in the case of institutions that use the IRB Approach, the implementation will be conducted simultaneously with the broader review of IRB methodologies, and hence sufficient time for implementation is necessary. The EBA understands these concerns and envisages a phase-in approach with sufficiently long implementation periods. These expectations have been expressed in detail in the EBA’s Opinion on the implementation of the regulatory review of the IRB Approach, published on 4 February 2016 7.	0
92. Where, in accordance with the second sub-paragraph of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No     575/2013, the definition of default has been applied at the level of an individual credit facility     with regard to retail exposures, institutions should not consider automatically the different     exposures to the same obligor defaulted at the same time. Nevertheless institutions should     take into account that some indications of default are related with the condition of the     obligor rather than the status of a particular exposure. This refers in particular to the     indications of unlikeliness to pay related with the bankruptcy of the obligor as specified in     points (e) and (f) of Article 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Where such indication of     default occurs, institutions should treat all exposures to the same obligor as defaulted     regardless of the level of application of the definition of default.	93. Institutions should consider also other indications of unlikeliness to pay and specify, in line     with their internal policies and procedures, which indications of unlikeliness to pay reflect the     overall situation of an obligor rather than that of the exposure. Where such other indications     of unlikeliness to pay occur, all exposures to the obligor should be considered defaulted     regardless of the level of application of the definition of default.	0
61. The systems used to measure the IRRBB should be capable of capturing the IRRBB characteristics     of all products. The systems should also allow the disaggregation of the impact of individual     IRRBB instruments/portfolios at the risk level of the banking book.	62. For complex, structured products in particular, the transaction system should be able to gather     information about the separate parts of the product and to capture their IRRBB characteristics     (e.g. the characteristics of assets and liabilities grouped by certain characteristics like repricing     dates or optionality elements). The institution should ensure that the IT system is able to keep up     with the introduction of new products.	0

48. In accordance with IRRBB 5, institutions should not rely upon the ‘standard shock’ as the only     measure of their IRRBB. In particular, they should also have an earnings measure, and should     consider whether alternative economic value measures are better suited to their business     model.	2.4.

   139. Credit institutions should monitor indicators relating to forbearance activities using a       meaningful breakdown, which could include the type and duration of arrears, the type of       exposure, the probability of recovery, the size of the exposures or the total amount of       exposures to the same borrower or group of connected clients, and the number of       forbearance solutions applied in the past.	   6.2.3         Assessing the borrower’s repayment capacity	0
Timely identification of default is important to make sure that accurate information is used for risk management purposes, for instance that the information on the default is available at the moment when further credit decisions are taken for the obligor. For that reason information about the default of a client should be available in the business units of the institution without undue delay and whenever information about the status of the obligor is used for any management purposes including internal or external reporting and calculation of capital requirements. Option c introduces principle-based guidance to institutions for setting the frequency of days past due. This option would not achieve full harmonisation with regard to the frequency of counting of days past due, but for the purpose of estimation of risk parameters the appropriate date of default would in any case have to be identified ensuring sufficient harmonisation in that regard. This option minimises the required modifications to IT systems and therefore does not lead to excessive operational costs.	Since what matters is the accuracy of the information used for the purpose of risk management and option c achieves this objective by setting out the principles for the timely recognition of default, as well as creating a more prudential regulatory framework with less operational cost, it is selected as the preferred option.	0
    Institutions may apply the period referred to in point (a) to all exposures or apply different     periods for different types of exposures.	72. For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, and where     distressed restructuring according to paragraph 49 of these guidelines applies to a defaulted     exposure, regardless of whether such restructuring was carried out before or after the     identification of default, institutions should consider that no trigger of default continues to     apply to a previously defaulted exposure, where at least 1 year has passed from the latest     between one of the following events:	0

Credit institutions should estimate the migration rates and the quality of the performing       exposures month by month, so that actions can be prioritised and taken promptly to inhibit       deterioration of portfolio quality. Migration matrices can be further broken down by       exposure type (retail mortgage, consumer, real estate), by business unit or by other       subportfolio to identify whether the driver of the flows can be attributed to a specific       subportfolio.	0

Key outcomes of second- and          third-line activities as well as defined mitigating actions and progress on those needs should          be reported to the management body regularly.	      91.In the implementation of the control framework, larger and more complex credit institutions          should apply all three lines of defence; the second line of defence does not have to be NPE          specific and may be performed by the credit risk (control) function.	0

As workout activities may place significant demands on resources, credit         institutions should consider if it is appropriate to choose to use fixed-term contracts,         internal/external outsourcing or joint ventures for NPE workout activities. However, the final         responsibility for these activities remains with the credit institution. In the event that         outsourcing is used, credit institutions should ensure that such outsourcing is arranged in         accordance with the applicable legislation or regulatory requirements.	0

89. IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.37, does not define default, but requires credit institutions to define     default in a manner consistent with that used for internal credit risk management. IFRS 9,     paragraph B5.5.37, also includes a rebuttable presumption that default does not occur later     than 90 days past due. When adopting a definition of default for accounting purposes, credit     institutions should be guided by the definition used for regulatory purposes provided in     Article 178 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 29, which includes both:	a. a qualitative criterion by which ‘the institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its    credit obligations to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries in full,    without recourse by the institution to actions such as realising security’ (‘unlikeliness to pay’    events); and	0

   205.

If there is material volatility in the market prices, the institution should       demonstrate that the valuation of the collateral is sufficiently conservative.	                                                                                                    53 FINAL REPORT – GUIDELINES ON MANAGEMENT OF NON-PERFORMING AND FORBORNE EXPOSURES	0

68. Credit institutions should have the necessary tools to ensure a robust estimate and timely     recognition of ECL. Given that information on historical loss experience or the impact of     current conditions may not fully reflect the credit risk in lending exposures, credit institutions     should use their experienced credit judgement to thoroughly incorporate the expected     impact of all reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, including     macroeconomic factors, on its estimate of ECL. A credit institution’s use of its experienced     credit judgement should be documented in the credit institution’s credit risk methodology     and subject to appropriate oversight.	69. Historical information provides a useful basis for the identification of trends and correlations     needed to identify the credit risk drivers for lending exposures. However, ECL estimates must     not ignore the impact of (forward-looking) events and conditions on those drivers. The     estimate should reflect the expected future cash shortfalls resulting from such impact.	0

7.   These Guidelines were drafted taking into account complaints procedures that CAs have already      put in place to deal with complaints under Article 80 of Directive 2007/64/EC (PSD1). In      particular, Article 80(1) of PSD1 provides that ‘Member States shall ensure that procedures are      set up which allow payment service users and other interested parties including consumer      associations, to submit complaints to the CAs with regard to PSPs’ alleged infringements of the      provisions of national law implementing the provisions of this Directive’. Article 82 of PSD1      further states that Member States shall take all the measures necessary to ensure that the      complaints procedures provided for in Article 80(1) and 81(1) are administered by the      authorities empowered to ensure compliance with the provisions of national law adopted      pursuant to the requirements laid down in that Article.	8.   In summary, these Guidelines are aimed at fulfilling the EBA’s overall objective, as set out in      Article 1(5) of the EBA Regulation, of ensuring the consistent, efficient and effective application      of the legislative acts that fall into the EBA’s scope of action.	0
18. In addition, the EBA would like to highlight that CAs can request additional information from     complainants if the information provided is deemed insufficient for the assessment of the     complaint.	19. However, to address the issues raised, and to bring greater clarity, the EBA deleted the first part     of Guideline 2.1., which indicated that the information specified in the Guideline is requested     when the complaint is being submitted. The EBA then separated the existing Guideline 2.1. into     two new Guidelines: the new Guideline 2.1. concerning the request for information by CAs, and     Guideline 2.2. concerning the recording of that information.	0

The Guidelines will apply from 13 January 2018.	                                                                                                4 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON REMUNERATION OF SALES STAFF	0
   Similarly, the competent authority should exclude in its supervisory practices the application of    certain categories and indicators that are subject to rebuttable presumption set out in    paragraphs 12 and 13 respectively, if it deems that such categories and indicators cannot apply    to certain types of investment firms.

7. These guidelines clarify the notions of investments in venture capital firms and investments in    private equity as mentioned in Article 128(2), points (a) and (c), CRR. The guidelines also specify    which types of exposures, other than those mentioned in Article 128(2) CRR, are to be    associated with particularly high risk and under which circumstances, in line with the mandate    in Article 128(3) CRR.

   100. In determining the frequency, scope and scale of the controls to be carried out, credit       institutions should take into account the level of NPEs and whether significant irregularities       and weaknesses have been identified by recent audits.	   101. Based on the results of its controls, the internal audit function should make       recommendations to the management body, bringing possible improvements to their       attention.	0
exposures, the assessment for high risk purposes contradicts the intrinsic nature of multilateral development banks, which are created for economic and social development projects and have large sovereign membership. However, as pointed out in the previous paragraph, the guidelines cannot limit the general scope of Article 128(3) CRR.	Finally, excluding SMEs from the scope of the guidelines was considered. In this regard, it was deemed that their assessment for high risk purposes might negatively affect the financing of SMEs, which play a fundamental role in creating economic growth and providing employment in the Union market (see recital 44 of CRR). This argument has been developed in the ‘Background and rationale’ section of the Consultation Paper. However, Article 128(3) of the CRR applies to SMEs through the CRR and the guidelines cannot reduce the general scope of that article as pointed out above. It should be noted, however, that it is very improbable that SME exposures will fall under the types of exposures captured by paragraphs 4 and 5 and therefore it was considered preferential to keep SMEs within the scope of the assessment, as otherwise their assessment for the purpose of Article 128(3) might be insufficiently harmonised.	0

44.It is worth noting that the guidance laid down in these GL builds on the general presumption        of the advanced IRB approach (i.e. where the institution uses own estimates of LGDs) where        risk parameters are quantified based on observed data. Therefore, as a first step and in line        with the hierarchy of approaches, an institution needs to assess whether for a type of exposure        under consideration sufficient loss data are available to assess the impact of a considered        downturn period identified in accordance with the RTS on economic downturn. If that is the        case, the institution follows the guidance for downturn LGD estimation based on observed        impact laid down in this section.	    45.In order to ensure that all relevant aspects of the economic loss calculated in accordance with        subsection 6.3.1 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation are covered appropriately, the minimum        components of such an impact assessment are prescribed in paragraph 27 of the GL. In detail,        the proposed impact assessment requires institutions to analyse whether there is evidence of        impact of the downturn period under consideration on the four following components, namely	0
5. These guidelines specify how to apply corrections to the calculation of the modified duration    to reflect prepayment risk, in accordance with the mandate conferred to the EBA in the last    subparagraph of Article 340(3) of Regulation (EU) No575/2013 13.	Scope of application	0

These Guidelines recognise that the risks faced by each institution vary significantly depending on its business and funding model, its activities and structure, its size or its interconnectedness to other institutions or to the financial system in general. The Guidelines also recognise that each institution should include both qualitative and quantitative indicators which are the most relevant when developing its recovery plan. Moving from this premise, the Guidelines provide the requirements that institutions should meet when developing the framework for recovery plan indicators, and specify the minimum list of categories that should be included in all recovery plans: capital, liquidity, profitability and asset quality. Additionally, the Guidelines identify two other categories of recovery plan indicators (marketbased indicators and macroeconomic indicators) that should be included in the recovery plan unless the institution justifies to the competent authorities that they are not relevant to its legal structure, risk profile, size and/or complexity (i.e. a rebuttable presumption). For each category of recovery plan indicators, the Guidelines spell out specific indicators that should be included unless the institution justifies to the competent authorities that they are not relevant to its legal structure, risk profile, size and/or complexity (i.e. a rebuttable presumption). Finally, the Guidelines recognise that institutions should not limit their set of indicators to the minimum list. Within this context, the Guidelines provide a list with additional recovery plan indicators for illustration purposes only.	                                                                                                    3 GUIDELINES ON RECOVERY PLAN INDICATORS	0
21. Credit institutions should consider a wide range of information when applying ECL accounting     models. Information considered should be relevant to the assessment of credit risk and     measurement of ECL of the particular lending exposure being assessed, and should include     information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic     conditions. Information which is ultimately included in the assessment of credit risk and     measurement of ECL should also be reasonable and supportable. Credit institutions should     use their experienced credit judgement in determining the range of relevant information that	                                                                                                  17 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS’ CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES	0

91. In formulating the estimate of the amount equal to 12-month ECL, credit institutions should     consider reasonable and supportable information, as referred to in the Definitions and in     Principle 6 of these guidelines, that affect credit risk, especially forward-looking information,     including macroeconomic factors. Credit institutions should exercise experienced credit     judgement to consider both qualitative and quantitative information that may affect the     credit institution’s assessment of credit risk. IFRS 9 provides that an entity does not need to     undertake an exhaustive search for information when measuring an amount equal to 12-     month ECL. However, credit institutions should actively incorporate information that may     affect the estimate of ECL, and credit institutions should not exclude or ignore relevant     information that is reasonably available.	92. Where a credit institution originates high-credit-risk exposures (which should not be     understood, in the context of this paragraph, as meaning the opposite of ‘low credit risk’     exposures as described by IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.10) and their allowances are initially     measured at 12-month ECL, the credit institution should monitor these exposures closely for     significant increases in credit risk to ensure a timely movement of the exposure to lifetime     ECL measurement, in order to take into account that high risk exposures are likely to exhibit     greater volatility and to experience a more rapid increase in credit risk.	0

From the provisional lists, the EBA is mandated to develop draft regulatory technical standards (RTS), by 18 September 2016 setting out the standardised Union terminology for those services that are common to at least a majority of Member States. The other two mandates for the EBA are to develop implementing technical standards (ITS), also by 18 September 2016, on a standardised presentation format for the fee information document and its common symbol and for the statement of fees and its common symbol. Both ITSs will require consumer testing. Before coming into effect, these technical standards have to be adopted by the Commission. Once the RTS have entered into force, there will be a further nine-month period, as set out in Article 29(2), at the end of which payment service providers (PSPs) will have to start providing information in line with the Directive.	As set out in Recital 15 of the Directive, it is vital for consumers to be able to understand fees so that they are able to compare offers from different PSPs and make informed decisions as to which payment account is most suitable for their needs. Comparison between fees is made more difficult if PSPs use different terminology for the same services and provide information in different formats. Standardised terminology, coupled with targeted fee information presented in a consistent format covering the most representative services linked to payment accounts, may help consumers to understand and compare fees.	0
Consistent identification of default of a single obligor	80. For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 79, institutions should implement adequate     procedures and mechanisms to ensure that the default of a single obligor is identified     consistently across the institution with regard to all exposures to this obligor in all relevant IT     systems, including in all the legal entities within the group and in all geographical locations     where it is active in ways other than via a legal entity.	0
86. In accordance with paragraph 5.5.5 of IFRS 9, ’if, at the reporting date, the credit risk on a     financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, an entity shall     measure the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month     expected credit losses’. Credit institutions should measure ECL for all lending exposures and a     nil allowance should be rare because ECL estimates are a probability-weighted amount that     should always reflect the possibility that a credit loss will occur (see paragraphs 5.5.17 and	5.5.18 of IFRS 9). A nil allowance could however occur, for example, for fully collateralised     loans (although credit institutions should be cautious when developing estimates of collateral     value, as valuation of collateral at origination may change over the life of the loan).	0

Currently, competent authorities comply with the technical and administrative standards needed to implement these Guidelines. The EBA survey shows that the required submission channels are already in place in all Members States that responded to the survey. It is expected that there will be a one-time cost to amend the current complaints procedures system, allowing competent authorities to request and, if applicable, process and assess the required information. The additional information received from complainants will benefit competent authorities that are responsible for the follow-up of complaints, allowing them to process the received complaints in a prompter and more efficient manner. Complainants are also expected to support all competent authorities in their responsibility to ensure payment service providers’ compliance with PSD2. The complaints procedures under these Guidelines will set standards which are already in place in some Member States, and thereby unify them at the EU level rather than create new standards.	The Guidelines further affect payment service users and other interested parties by making the process of submitting a complaint more transparent. Submission by complainants will raise awareness of and trust in procedures for complaints of alleged infringements of Directive	0

   155. When granting forbearance measures to performing exposures, credit institutions should       assess whether these measures lead to a need to reclassify the exposure as non-performing.       Granting forbearance measures to NPEs does not clear their non-performing status: the       exposures should continue to be identified as non-performing for at least one year of the cure       period after the granting of the forbearance measures, as specified in Annex V to Commission       Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 and in section 7.3.3.	   156.

The obligor should be considered defaulted when distressed restructuring is likely to result in a diminished financial obligation. Distressed restructuring has been defined similarly to forbearance; therefore, those forborne exposures where the forbearance measures are likely to result in a diminished financial obligation should be classified as defaulted.	The policy options relate to if the GL should introduce a threshold for distressed restructuring for the scale at which the financial obligation is diminished and if they do then in what form this threshold should be specified. In this regard, the following options have been considered:	0
4.        General requirements on downturn LGD estimation                   This section clarifies, inter alia, at which level institutions should calibrate downturn                   LGDs for the purpose of providing downturn LGD estimates per grade or pool.                   Moreover, it provides guidance on how to select the finally relevant downturn                   period(s) in case multiple downturn periods have been identified when applying the                   RTS on economic downturn.	4.1       Requirements that apply to the final downturn LGD estimates                   This subsection contains requirements to ensure that downturn LGDs are more                   conservative than the long-run average LGD as required by Article 181(1)(b) of the                   CRR. Moreover, it provides guidance on how to ensure that LGD models containing                   risk drivers sensitive to the economic cycle are appropriately calibrated to downturn                   conditions. Last, it contains the requirement that the final downturn LGDs are to be                   compared with a non-binding challenger (reference value), which should be                   calculated as set out in section 8 of the GL.	0

Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn         period is not available but it is possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered         downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate         downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these         guidelines.	25. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn         period is not available, and it is not possible to quantify downturn LGD for the considered         downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate         downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 7 of these         guidelines.	0

Conversely, if we consider now a callable bond whose embedded optionality is deep out of the money we will observe that both the value of the option and the corresponding ‘correction’ of the modified duration are close to zero. In this case, the behaviour of the callable bond is nearly the same as the one that would be observed for the plain vanilla bond alone; accordingly, the CMD becomes almost the same as the MD, the effect of changes in IRR would affect both bonds in a similar way and the capital requirement would also be the same.	Both effects can be observed in Graph 4 below, where the relationship price-yield of a 20 year callable bond is shown (see technical annex for further elaboration):	0
Summary of key issues raised by the BSG and the EBA’s response	The BSG broadly supported the Guidelines under consultation but believed that these Guidelines should be enhanced by including additional requirements which can be summarised as follows:	0
EBA/GL/2017/15	14/11/2017	0
Scope of application	7. These guidelines apply in relation to Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU, 8 which requires        institutions to have robust governance arrangements, including a clear organisational        structure with well-defined, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility, effective        processes to identify, manage, monitor and report the risks they are or might be exposed to        and adequate control mechanisms.	0
94. Additionally, where a significant part of the exposures to the obligor is in default, institutions     may consider it unlikely that the other obligations of that obligor will be paid in full without     recourse to actions such as realising security and treat them as defaulted as well.	                                                                                                   40 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	0
18. The EBA assessed the merits of these concerns and concluded that, as stated in paragraph 16     of section 3.2 of the CP, the NCAs will apply these Guidelines in a proportionate manner as a     general principle of EU law. However, the EBA underlines that all financial institutions should     comply with these Guidelines and should ensure at all times the alignment of their     remuneration incentives with the fair treatment of consumers. Where these Guidelines     indicate an outcome, the outcome may be achieved by the financial institution through     different means. The appropriateness of the means used by the financial institution will be     assessed by competent authorities, taking into account the business model, scale and     complexity of the financial institution.	19. The EBA therefore believes that the concern of the respondents is sufficiently addressed and     did not amend the Guidelines. Additionally, more detailed clarifications are provided in the     feedback table in chapter 4.2 with regard to the application of particular Guidelines in     relation to small entities.	0

The payment service provider should record data from all its agents, providing payment        services in the EEA and aggregate these data with the rest of the data before reporting to the        home competent authority.

The advantage of this option is that it establishes a harmonised approach with regard to the way the sales of credit obligations are assessed. On the other hand, a major disadvantage of the option is that institutions could set the thresholds at very different levels and in some cases defaults might not be recognised even if the loss seems material. As a result it would not lead to increased comparability of risk estimates.	Option c suggests the same calculation as described under option b with the addition of a 5% cap (i.e. the threshold set by the institutions should not be higher than 5%). The option inherits some of the advantages of option b but also enhances comparability of default rates and capital requirements across institutions and Member States by significantly reducing the possible range of thresholds. However, the threshold, if set too low, may lead to overestimation of the probability of default and underestimation of the loss given default (as described also under option a).	0
Duration (D) and Modified Duration (MD) are well known concepts used in finance to measure the sensitivity (percentage change) in price for a unit change (parallel movements) in its Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of any financial asset that consists of fixed cash flows.

QIS results: technical past due situations	The scenario specified for testing the impact of the introduction of the definition of technical past due situations corresponds to the provisions included in paragraph 20 of the consultation paper on the GL. Therefore, where institutions use a broader definition of technical past due situations an increase in default rate accompanied by a possible decrease in LGD for IRB institutions could be expected. The results of the QIS confirm this expectation and Table 9 in the QIS report shows a modest increase in default rate and decrease in LGD for IRB institutions across all exposure classes under consideration. The overall impact on capital is also very modest, corresponding to an overall decrease in capital adequacy ratio of around 0.01 p.p. based on own funds (0.01 p.p. based on CET1) for the sample of SA institutions and an increase in capital adequacy ratio of around 0.018 p.p. based on own funds (0.010 p.p. based on CET1) for the sample of IRB institutions. The final GL relax the definition of technical past due situations with respect to the consultation paper, including in particular some specific wording for factoring arrangements. This would if anything reduce the impact observed in the QIS, which could be taken as a upper bound for the potential impact.	0

53. Credit institutions should have in place a robust process to ensure appropriate initial grouping     of their lending exposures.

For the purposes of Guideline 1.1, the payment service provider (including the payment        instrument issuer where applicable) should report only payment transactions that have been        initiated and executed (including acquired where applicable). The payment service provider        should not report data on payment transactions that, however linked to any of the        circumstances referred to in Guideline 1.1, have not been executed and have not resulted in        a transfer of funds in accordance with PSD2 provisions.	0
Option c suggests the same calculation as described under option b with the addition of a 5% cap (i.e. the threshold set by the institutions should not be higher than 5%). The option inherits some of the advantages of option b but also enhances comparability of default rates and capital requirements across institutions and Member States by significantly reducing the possible range of thresholds. However, the threshold, if set too low, may lead to overestimation of the probability of default and underestimation of the loss given default (as described also under option a).	Finally, option d leaves the threshold for the materiality of the economic loss to be set by the institutions. The option is fully flexible as it gives the institutions room to align with internal risk management and takes into account the perceived materiality of the economic loss. However, the option fails to establish a harmonised regulatory framework, and it may lead to non-risk-based differences in risk estimates and to underestimation of capital requirements.	0

Specifically, paragraph 5(b), point (i), lists some potential indicators for the existence of high risk exposures (for exposures similar to all types of specialised lending exposures). These pointers are based on the criteria that would be used by an internal ratings based (IRB) institution when applying the slotting approach for specialised lending exposures. However, as these guidelines are intended for institutions using the Standardised Approach, it is not expected that SA banks apply the regulatory technical standards (RTS) on slotting4, but that they take the overall principles as listed in paragraph 5(b), point (i), into account for the purpose of assessing whether or not an exposure similar to a specialised lending exposure should be considered high risk. It should be noted that the guidelines do not generally hinder a potential preferential treatment of infrastructure projects.	As pointed out above, Article 128(3) CRR is not limited to certain exposure classes and therefore the types of exposures specified in paragraph 5(a) and (b) should be assessed for exposures to central governments or central banks, exposures to regional governments and local authorities and exposures to public sector entities. However, in practice, it is unlikely that any exposure of these exposure classes will fall under the types mentioned in paragraph 5(a) or (b). Similarly, the same reasoning holds for exposures to multilateral development banks listed in Article 117(2) CRR. The assessment for high risk purposes may be perceived to be contradictory to the intrinsic nature of multilateral development banks that are created for economic and social development projects; yet, as these exposures are not excluded from Article 128 CRR, they cannot be excluded from the scope of these guidelines. As well as this, exposures towards small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will generally not constitute financing of speculative investments or specialised lending and it is therefore improbable that exposures to these borrowers are considered high risk as a result of paragraph 5(a) and (b). It is therefore considered that the assessment of SME exposures for high risk purposes under paragraph 5 will not negatively affect the financing of SMEs that play a	0

    50.Finally, the last paragraph on the impact assessment requires that any lag between a downturn        period and its potential impact on the relevant loss data has to be taken into account. Due to        the individual situations regarding data availability as well as the specifics of a considered type        of exposure, no guidance is set out regarding the length of the time lags that should be        considered.	    51.The guidance regarding the calibration of downturn LGD for cases in which loss data are        available to assess the impact of a considered downturn period on a considered calibration        segment is laid down in section 5 of the final GL. Paragraph 28 clarifies that the resulting LGD        estimation needs to be coherent with the outcome obtained from the impact analysis. In other        words, the final downturn LGDs should appropriately account for the material impacts of a        considered downturn period on (i) the realised LGDs; (ii) the annual recoveries; (ii) the facilities        returned to non-defaulted status; and (iv) time in default. The policy leaves flexibility to        institutions with respect to the detailed methodology applied for the purpose of calibration of        downturn LGD based on results of the impact assessment. The rationale for this is that the EBA        considers that there is no one-size-fits-all aggregation scheme for the results obtained from        the analyses required in paragraph 27. Depending on the risk profile of the considered type of        exposure it might be appropriate to choose the average LGD by vintage of defaults affected by        the considered downturn period where this best reflects the results obtained from the impact        assessment laid down in paragraph 27(a), points (i) to (iv). In another case, in particular where        the average LGD would incorporate significant catch-up effects due to late recoveries when        economic conditions improved (as outlined in paragraph 45 above), it might be more        appropriate to base the downturn LGD estimation on the impact observed on annual        recoveries per source of cash flow. The flexibility to select an appropriate methodology to        calibrate downturn LGD includes the ability to use the ‘haircut approach’, outlined in section 6        in the GL, as a methodology under section 5 of the GL.	0

If the Polish DGS guarantees         repayments in PLN, British pounds (GBP) or Swiss francs (CHF), following a failure of a         branch of a Polish bank in the UK, the majority of UK depositors will get the money back	                                                                                                 11 GUIDELINES ON COOPERATION BETWEEN DEPOSIT GUARANTEE SCHEMES	0

65. With regard to each indication of unlikeliness to pay institutions should define the adequate     methods of their identification, including the sources of information and frequency of     monitoring. The sources of information should include both internal and external sources,     including in particular relevant external databases and registers.	6.

SCRA related to incurred but not reported losses (IBNR) as specified in Article 1(5)(c) of Regulation (EU) No 183/2014 should not be considered an indication of unlikeliness to pay. These SCRA cover losses for which historical experience, adjusted on the basis of current observable data, indicates that the loss has occurred but the institution is not yet aware which individual exposure has suffered these losses. Since such SCRA are not related to a decline in the credit quality of any specific exposure they should not be considered an indication of unlikeliness to pay of a specific obligor.	It is expected that by the time of implementation of these guidelines many institutions will already apply IRFS 9 instead of current accounting standards. Since these new rules are significantly different from the currently used IAS 39 and introduce the concept of expected credit losses, which is new in the accounting framework, the EBA considers it necessary to specify the treatment of provisions under IFRS 9 – despite those rules not having entered into effect. It is consequently proposed that as a general rule all exposures classified as Stage 3, i.e. exposures treated as credit-impaired under IFRS 9, should be treated as defaulted. Only a few exceptions from that rule have been specified and these include:	0
98.The IRRBB stress-testing framework should include clearly defined objectives, scenarios tailored    to the institution’s businesses and risks, well-documented assumptions and sound    methodologies.	99.In enterprise-wide stress tests, the interaction of IRRBB with other risk categories (e.g. credit    risk, liquidity risk, market risks), and any material second-round effects, should be computed.	0
4.2 Views of the Banking Stakeholder Group (BSG) The BSG supported the overarching objective of the guidelines, which is to establish a framework on the use and application of the resolution tools, and expressed the expectation that they will provide for the convergence of supervisory and resolution practice in the implementation of these tools by ensuring consistent and high regulatory standards in this area and a level playing field across the EU. The BSG pointed out that it is fundamental to consider the impact of the guidelines on other institutions and financial markets, including infrastructure providers and nonfinancial institution customers, and also the circumstances that are relevant for the risk that marketing the institution under resolution presents in terms of aggravating uncertainty and a loss of market confidence that could disturb financial stability.	The BSG also agreed with the guidelines that it is necessary to look for an optimal balance between competitive, transparent and ‘fair’ market conditions and the increased efficiency (lower value and terms) of the sale and considered the guidelines to be sufficiently comprehensive and detailed, and the BSG does not have any particular concerns about the conflicts between marketing requirements and the sale of business tool.	0
    8. Competent authorities should ensure that credit institutions comply with these guidelines        on an individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated basis in accordance with Article 109 of        Directive 2013/36/EU.	    9.

                 b. it is impossible to assess adequately whether the exposure falls under point (a).	To begin with, paragraph 3 presents the scope of application. As the mandate in Article 128(3) does not limit the application of the guidelines to a series of specific exposure classes, institutions need to assess all the exposures on their balance sheet with a view to identifying those that are associated with high risk. Consequently, the guidelines do not provide an exhaustive list of types of exposures to be classified as exposures of particularly high risk. However, empirically it is more likely that exposures that could be associated with high risk be more frequent in some asset classes, such as those in Article 112 CRR points (g), (p) and (q). The rationale for this guidance is to ensure more harmonisation in the application of Article 128(3) CRR under these guidelines.	0
Institutions should choose the level of application of the definition of default for retail exposures so that it reflects their internal risk management practices. In exceptional situations institutions may be allowed to apply the definition of default at the level of an obligor for some types of retail exposures and at the level of a credit facility for others.	The GL require that if an institution decides to use different levels of application of the definition of default for different types of retail exposures the scope of application of each definition of default should be clearly specified. In addition to this, the GL considered:	0

2.     Documentation, notification and accessibility	2.1.   Institutions should document remuneration policies and practices, keep them for audit        purposes for at least five years from the last date that they applied, and make them        available to the competent authorities upon request. This documentation should include,        but is not limited to:	0
   94.In order to ensure that adequate control mechanisms are implemented, credit institutions       should have internal policies in place on the NPE workout framework. The managers of the       operational units are responsible for ensuring that these internal policies are implemented,       including through their incorporation into IT procedures. Annex 4 to these guidelines sets out       key elements of NPE framework-related policies that should be implemented in credit       institutions.	   5.3.2         Second line of defence controls	0

61. Article 14(6) in connection with Article 4(9) of Directive 2014/49/EU requires effective     exchange of information between DGSs, in accordance with confidentiality and the protection     of data pertaining to depositors’ accounts. It also requires processing of data to be done in     accordance with Directive 95/46/EC.	62. While the abovementioned provision ensures a common minimum set of standards of     confidentiality and data protection, it does not preclude cooperation agreements from setting     more stringent standards, provided that this is agreed to in the cooperation agreements.	0

2. Guidelines give the EBA view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European System of    Financial Supervision or of how Union law should be applied in a particular area. Competent    authorities as defined in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 to whom guidelines apply    should comply by incorporating them into their practices as appropriate (e.g. by amending their    legal framework or their supervisory processes), including where guidelines are directed    primarily at institutions.

84.Institutions should consider non-performing exposures (net of provisions) as interest rate    sensitive instruments reflecting expected cash flows and their timing.	85.When measuring their exposure to IRRBB, institutions should not purely rely on the calculation    and outcomes of the supervisory outlier tests as described in section 4.5, or any additional    outlier test developed by the competent authority, but should develop and use their own    assumptions and calculation methods. However, the supervisory outlier tests should be fully    integrated into the internal framework for the management of IRRBB and should be used as    complementary tools for measuring exposure to IRRBB.	0
13.Building on the BCBS guidance, these guidelines aim at ensuring sound credit risk management    practices for credit institutions, associated with the implementation and ongoing application of    ECL accounting models. Furthermore, they set out the supervisory expectations for credit    institutions related to sound credit risk practices associated with implementing and applying an    ECL accounting model.	14.In particular, on the considerations on proportionate application of the EBA guidelines, the EBA    notes that all credit institutions applying IFRS 9 should ensure that they meet the objectives of    IFRS 9 when applying the standard. However, the EBA understands that the way of meeting these    objectives may differ across credit institutions; for example, different techniques or models may    be used in the measurement of ECL. Credit institutions should comply with these guidelines in a    proportionate manner taking into account various criteria, such as their size and internal    organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities and portfolios, as described    in paragraph 17 of the guidelines. Credit institutions should, however, take into consideration if    using practical expedients that the objective of IFRS 9 is to estimate ECL to reflect an unbiased and    probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes    (IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.17)	0
2. The guidelines set out the EBA view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European    System of Financial Supervision or of how EU law should be applied in a particular area.    Competent authorities as defined in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 to whom    the guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them into their practices as appropriate    (e.g. by amending their legal framework or their supervisory processes), including where    guidelines are directed primarily at institutions.

2.1 in terms of both volume (i.e. number of transactions or fraudulent transactions) and value        (i.e. amount of transactions or fraudulent transactions). They should report volumes and        values in actual units, with two decimals for values.	2.3.   A payment service provider authorised, or a branch established, in a Member State of the        euro area should report the values in euro currency, whereas a payment service provider        authorised, or a branch established, in a Member State not participating in the euro area        should report in the currency of that Member State. The reporting payment service providers        should convert data for values of transactions or fraudulent transactions denominated in a        currency other than the euro currency or the relevant Member State’s official currency into        the currency they should report in, using the relevant exchange rates applied to these        transactions or the average ECB reference exchange rate for the applicable reporting period.	0

58. When assessing the adequacy of the allowances credit institutions should take into account     relevant factors and expectations at the reporting date that may affect the collectability of     remaining cash flows over the life of a group of lending exposures or a single lending     exposure. Credit institutions should consider information which goes beyond historical and     current data, and take into account reasonable and supportable forward-looking information,     including macroeconomic factors, that are relevant to the exposure(s) being evaluated (for     example retail or wholesale) in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.	59. Depending on the ability to incorporate forward-looking information into the ECL estimate,     credit institutions may use individual or collective assessment approaches; regardless of the     assessment approach used, they should be consistent with the relevant accounting     requirements and not result in materially different allowance measurements. Together,     individual and collective assessments form the basis for the allowance for ECL.	0

     Considering the previous example, it could be assumed for simplicity that the methodology applied      for the regression discards all but one economic factor, e.g. GDP of the past year. In this case, the      error of this model could be assessed as 𝑌̂0 − 𝑌0 for a chosen point in time 𝑡0 (where the internal      loss would need to be extrapolated) and the following could be used as an estimator for the variance      of the residuals (under the assumption that the residuals are normally distributed), where n denotes      the number of observations (points in time) used for the regression:                                                                      𝑛	1               2                                 𝑠𝑌2   = 𝑉𝑎𝑟 ( Yˆ0  Y0 ) =       ∑ (𝑌𝑖 − Yˆi )                                                              𝑛−2                                                                      𝑖=1	0

In the case of institutions that use the SA the impact of the changes will be relatively less significant as there will be no need to adjust historical data unless the institution decides to apply for permission to use the IRB Approach in the future. Nevertheless, in the case of those institutions for which the default definition will change significantly the costs might still be material as it might require changes to the processes and possibly also IT systems used to collect the data and calculate capital requirements.	The QIS results generally show that the introduction of the harmonised definition of default proposed in the GL and in the RTS on the materiality threshold will lead to a modest increase in capital charges, corresponding to an overall reduction of capital adequacy ratios of around	0

Reporting requirements	3. According to Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, competent authorities must notify    the EBA that they comply or intend to comply with these Guidelines or otherwise give reasons    for non-compliance, by ([dd.mm.yyyy]). In the absence of any notification by this deadline,    competent authorities will be considered by the EBA to be non-compliant. Notifications should    be sent by submitting the form available on the EBA website to compliance@eba.europa.eu    with the reference ‘EBA/GL/2018/05’. Notifications should be submitted by persons with    appropriate authority to report compliance on behalf of their competent authorities. Any    change in the status of compliance must also be reported to the EBA.	0
Article 128(3) CRR provides a mandate to the European Banking Authority (EBA) to draft guidelines that specify which types of exposures, other than those mentioned in Article 128(2) CRR, are to be associated with particularly high risk and the circumstances under which this should happen. As a result of an exposure being identified as an ‘item of particularly high risk’, such exposure receives a risk weight of 150%.	The guidelines consist of two sections. The first section aims to clarify the notions of investments in venture capital firms and private equity as referred to in Article 128(2) CRR; the second section specifies the types of exposures other than those listed in points (a) to (d) that should be considered as high risk (and under which circumstances) by way of application of Article 128(3) CRR.	0
A. Problem identification	The issue addressed by the guidelines is the lack of common institutional and supervisory practices regarding the types of exposures that are associated with particularly high risk and under which circumstances. As a result of identifying an exposure that carries a particularly high risk by the application of Article 128(3) of the CRR, such an exposure receives a risk weight of 150%. All issues that have been considered during the development of these guidelines aim to harmonise the rules for the identification of exposures to be associated with particularly high risk.	0

29. Where the institution recognises events related to dilution risk of purchased receivables as     defined in point (53) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, these events should not     be considered as leading to the default of the obligor. Where the amount of receivable has     been reduced as a result of events related to dilution risk such as discounts, deductions,     netting or credit notes issued by the seller the reduced amount of receivable should be     included in the calculation of days past due. Where there is a dispute between the obligor and     the seller and such event is recognised as related to dilution risk the counting of days past due     should be suspended until the dispute is resolved.	30. Events recognised as related to dilution risk and hence excluded from the identification of     default should be included in the calculation of own funds requirements or internal capital for     dilution risk. Where institutions recognise significant number of events related to dilution risk,     they should analyse and document the reasons for such events and assess the possible     indications of unlikeliness to pay, in accordance with Articles 178(1) and (3) of Regulation (EU)     No 575/2013 and Section 5 of these guidelines.	0

138.   In the limited instances where past-due information is the best criterion available to a    credit institution to determine when exposures should move to the lifetime ECL category,    credit institutions should pay particular attention to their measurement of 12-month ECL    allowance to ensure that ECL are appropriately captured in accordance with the    measurement objective of IFRS 9. Moreover, credit institutions should take into account that    significant reliance on backward-looking information will introduce bias into the    implementation of an ECL accounting model and that they should ensure that the objectives    of the IFRS 9 impairment requirements (i.e. to reflect ECL that meet the stated measurement    objectives and to capture all significant increases in credit risk) are met.	32    For example, in some jurisdictions it is common practice for borrowers to delay repayment for certain exposures, but history shows that those missed payments are fully recouped in the succeeding months.	0
        However, where a downturn adjustment is applied to the long-run average LGD, this         requirement implies that the MoC applied to the final LGD estimate (i.e. LRA + downturn         adjustment + MoC) needs to account for both (i) the uncertainty related to the estimation of         long-run average LGD and (ii) the uncertainty related to the calculation of the downturn         adjustment.	          Example 2                 If the downturn LGD is calibrated at grade level and the long-run average LGD is                 calculated at calibration segment level for the purpose of calibration, here is one                 example of how this comparison could be done in practice.                 The institution could calculate the resulting downturn LGD estimates plus their                 corresponding MoCs for all facilities in the reference data set (specific to the                 calibration segment under consideration and on which the long-run average LGD is                 calculated) and compare the resulting (case-weighted) average downturn LGD with                 the long-run average LGD used for calibration.	0

Furthermore, limiting the use of practical expedients of IFRS 9 only to systemically important credit institutions or other credit institutions through these guidelines may be perceived as encouraging the use of practical expedients in general when it could be avoided, which would also be inconsistent with the objectives of IFRS 9, these guidelines and the BCBS guidance.	0
The duration-based calculation of general risk is one methodology that the EU institutions may follow to calculate own funds requirements against general risk on debt instruments. 14 Prepayment risk refers to an early unscheduled return of principal and the specifications of the duration-based calculation under Article 340 of the CRR do not account for this risk. The core problem that the current guidelines aim to address is the risk associated with the uncertainty around the return of principal on a fixed-income security, and in this case on debt instruments.	For instance, the issuer of a callable bond, i.e. a bond with an embedded call option has an incentive to exercise the call, i.e. to redeem the bond in advance, when the interest rate in the market decreases and reissue/refinance the original debt at a lower rate.	0
understanding and application of these concepts vary significantly among institutions it was necessary to provide clarification in this area.	It has to be noted that the main purpose of the RTS on the materiality threshold for past due exposures is to identify situations where small amounts are past due as a result of technical circumstances rather than the financial situation of the obligor and eliminate them from the estimation of risk parameters. Since the materiality threshold already serves the purpose of identification of technical delays in payments, all other cases, i.e. all exposures where the materiality threshold has been breached, have to be treated as actual defaults. Since the CRR does not envisage any additional exemptions from the days past due criterion the concept of ‘technical past due’ is defined as one of the following situations:	0

In the case of exposures defaulted due to the past due criterion 43% of the institutions link the start of the probation period to when the default triggers no longer apply, as prescribed in the GL. For exposures under distressed restructuring only 4% of the institutions link the start of the probation period to the latest event between the start of the restructuring measures and the default event, largely in line with what is prescribed in the GL. The most common approach (used by 33% of the institutions) is letting the probation period start when the restructuring measures are applied without checking whether this date is prior to or after the date of default or the end of any grace period.

The rationale for classifying Stage 2 exposures as defaulted is linked to the fact that it has been recognised that the credit risk has increased significantly, and so the indication of unlikeliness to pay prescribed in Article 178(3)(b) of the CRR applies. However, exposures classified as Stage 2 are described as not yet impaired, they are in general not yet materially past due and, additionally, at least some of them are classified to Stage 2 on a collective basis. Given these considerations it seems unduly conservative to treat all Stage 2 exposures as defaulted.	0

   67.Credit institutions should consider designing automated processes for NPE WUs for       homogeneous retail NPE portfolios.

For sole       traders and micro-enterprises, a combination of automated elements and a relationship       management approach should be considered.	   68.Smaller and less complex credit institutions (e.g. those that are classified in SREP Category 3       or 4) may have in place dedicated workout functions proportionate to their size, nature,       complexity and risk profile.

57. Credit institutions should implement sound credit risk methodologies with the objective that     the overall balance of the allowance for ECL is developed in accordance with the applicable     accounting framework and adequately reflects ECL within that framework.	58. When assessing the adequacy of the allowances credit institutions should take into account     relevant factors and expectations at the reporting date that may affect the collectability of     remaining cash flows over the life of a group of lending exposures or a single lending     exposure. Credit institutions should consider information which goes beyond historical and     current data, and take into account reasonable and supportable forward-looking information,     including macroeconomic factors, that are relevant to the exposure(s) being evaluated (for     example retail or wholesale) in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.	0

Credit institutions’ policies for the reclassification of non-performing FBEs should specify       practices for dispelling concerns regarding the borrower’s ability to comply with the postforbearance conditions set out in Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)       No 680/2014. These policies should establish criteria in terms of payments made during the       cure period of at least one year and define the borrower’s ability to comply with postforbearance conditions (to the extent that full repayment of the debt is likely) without being       reliant on the realisation of collateral at least by demonstrating payments of a not       insignificant amount of principal.

Once FBEs are classified as performing, either because they have met the conditions for       being reclassified from the non-performing category or because the granting of forbearance       measures did not lead to the classification of the exposure as non-performing, they should       continue to be identified as forborne until all the conditions for the discontinuation of the       classification of exposures as forborne under paragraph 256 of Annex V to Commission       Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 have been met.	   162.

For clients to which the EU accounting rules do not apply (e.g. natural persons, central governments, and clients that prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with the accounting rules of a third country), the guidelines provide a non-exhaustive list of criteria and indicators of control. This list is divided into two different sets: the first set consists of criteria that always constitute a control relationship among clients (e.g. holding the majority of the shareholders’ or members’ voting rights in another entity); the second set includes examples of indicators that should be considered by institutions in their assessment, as any of these indicators might constitute a control relationship among clients (e.g. power to decide on the strategy or direct the activities of an entity).	1   The 2009 CEBS ‘Guidelines on the implementation of the revised large exposures regime’ covered two aspects: the definition of connected clients and the treatment of transactions with exposures to underlying assets. These guidelines can be found here: https://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/37070/Guidelines-on-Large-exposures_connectedclients	0
   2.8.2           Internal governance	As the definition of default is particularly important for the IRB Approach and is the basis for estimation of all risk parameters, own funds requirements and expected loss calculation, specific requirements with regard to internal governance have been clarified for institutions that use the IRB Approach. In order to ensure that the default definition is implemented in a correct manner it should be approved by the management body, or by a committee designated by it, and by senior management in line with Article 189 of the CRR. Furthermore, in order to provide clarification on the so-called ‘use test’ requirements specified in Article 144 of the CRR it has been specified that these institutions should use the definition of default consistently for the purpose of own funds requirement calculation and internal risk management processes at least in the area of monitoring of exposures and internal reporting to senior management and the management body. Finally, the internal audit or another comparable independent auditing unit should review regularly the robustness and effectiveness of the process used by the institution for the identification of default of an obligor in accordance with Article 191 of the CRR.	0
53. Limit controls should be in place to ensure positions that exceed certain predetermined levels     trigger prompt management reaction.	54. Institutions using derivative instruments to mitigate IRRBB exposures should possess the     necessary knowledge and expertise. Each institution should demonstrate that it understands the     consequences of hedging with interest rate derivatives.	0
The level of application of the default definition for retail exposures should be based on the internal risk management practices of the institution. However, if an institution decided to use different levels of application of the definition of default for different types of retail exposures, the requirements of the CRR regarding default of an obligor might not be fully met. In particular, where the definition of default is used at the obligor level, default of any exposure of an obligor should result in default of all other exposures of this obligor. Where, however, some exposures of such an obligor are assessed at the individual facility level, default on one of these exposures would not result in default of all the obligor’s exposures. In order to avoid such a situation it is proposed that where institutions decide to use different levels of application of the definition of default for different types of retail exposures they should provide evidence that there are no or a very limited number of situations where the same clients are subject to different definitions of default at different levels of application.	                                                                                                      13 FINAL REPORT ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	0
In addition, we recommend that all investments for which a bank intends to develop a strategic business relationship with the company in question not be considered private capital for the purposes of these guidelines.

In the area of the counting of days past due harmonisation will be achieved predominantly through the RTS on the materiality threshold for past due exposures specified in accordance with Article 178(6) of the CRR. However, the draft guidelines provide clarification on those aspects of counting of days past due that are not covered in these RTS. In particular, it has been specified that if the credit arrangements allow the client to change the schedule, suspend or postpone the payments under certain conditions and the client acts within the rights granted in the contract, the changed, suspended or postponed instalments should not be considered past due. The counting of days past due should be based on the new schedule once it is specified because in that situation the client is no longer obliged to pay according to the initial conditions. Such rights for clients may be granted by institutions on the basis of a specific business strategy or may stem from national regulations related to consumer protection.	Similar considerations apply to a situation where repayments are suspended by force of law. As the client is legally not obliged to make payments in the suspension period, the counting of days past due should also be suspended. However, both of the described situations might indicate financial difficulties of the pbligor; therefore, institutions should assess the obligor for possible indications of unlikeliness to pay.	0
33.The institution’s risk appetite for IRRBB should be expressed in terms of the acceptable impact    of fluctuating interest rates on both earnings and economic value and should be reflected in    limits. Institutions with significant exposures to gap risk, basis risk or option risk should    determine their risk appetite in relation to each of these material sub-types of IRRBB.	34.The overall IRRBB strategy should also include the decision about the extent to which the    business model relies on generating earnings by ‘riding the yield curve’, i.e. funding assets with    a comparatively long repricing period with liabilities with a comparatively short repricing period.    Where the business model relies heavily on this source of earnings, the management body	0

1.   Competent authorities should assess if there are structural features in a transaction which      might undermine the claimed credit risk transfer to third parties, such as features like      optional calls or other contractual arrangements which in case of traditional securitisations      increase the likelihood that assets will be brought back onto the originator institution’s      balance sheet or in case of synthetic securitisations increase the likelihood that the credit      protection will be terminated before the transaction’s maturity.	2.   For traditional securitisations, only the following call options granted to originator      institutions should not be considered detrimental to achieving effective transfer of credit risk      by competent authorities, provided these call options do not grant an originator institution      the right to repurchase from the transferee the previously transferred exposure to realise      their benefits or oblige the originator institution to re-assume transferred credit risk:	0
Option d sets the threshold for the pulling effect at the 20% level. Although the option achieves full harmonisation and alignment with the supervisory framework, it lacks flexibility and leaves room for an excessive number of zero-loss defaults.	According to the results of the QIS almost three quarters of the institutions do not apply the pulling effect for the purpose of default identification. Taking into account this evidence together with the considerations related to the excessive recognition of zero-loss defaults and possible future changes in the supervisory reporting framework, it was decided that the pulling effect should not be introduced as an obligatory requirement for the purpose of the definition of default in the prudential framework; therefore, the preferred option is option a. Nevertheless, some institutions might still see default of some of exposures to an obligor as an indication of unlikeliness to pay for the remaining exposures to this obligor and might want to align the treatment of those exposures for prudential and reporting purposes. Therefore, it is proposed that where institutions consider it appropriate they may define an additional indication of unlikeliness to pay that will reflect the principle of the pulling effect.	0
16.The assessment of the additional factor Ψ should be based on historical data, obtained from    the institutions’ own experience or from external sources. Data on the behavioural factors    referred to in paragraph 15(b) may be obtained from the assessment of other balance sheet    elements subject to prepayment risk, such as those observed for retail clients in the nontrading book.	17.Institutions should calibrate the additional factor Ψ by assessing significant divergences    between the real behaviour historically observed for a type of client and the theoretical    behaviour that would have been envisaged for counterparties acting in a purely rational way.	0
Therefore, the current framework ignores such prepayment risk and hence it is not considered in the associated own funds requirements. This can jeopardise the level playing field in the EU banking sector, especially in terms of cross-border arrangements. Some Member States have national regulations adjusting the duration-based calculation to incorporate the prepayment risk; therefore, in theory institutions subject to this regulation have to correct 16 own funds against this risk while in other EU jurisdictions institutions are not subject to capital requirements under prepayment risk.

Other indications of unlikeliness to pay	58.

Those additional indications should be specified per type of     exposures, as defined in point (2) of Article 142(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, reflecting     their specificities, and they should be specified for all business lines, legal entities or     geographical locations.

Context of downturn LGD estimation	        3. In general terms, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is fully supportive of allowing a            diversity of model practices. The strength of internal models lies in the ability of institutions to            model on institution-specific data, which ensures a high degree of risk sensitivity and            constitutes an important characteristic of own funds requirements that should be maintained.            It is, however, also clear that this requires sufficiently granular data and specific guidance on            the calibration targets. In this context, these guidelines focus on the calibration target, i.e.            LGDs appropriate for an economic downturn (downturn LGDs), and not the calibration	0

The gamma sensitivities of the option tends to zero the more we move far from the par yield, so gamma sensitivities for the vanilla bond and the puttable bond tend to converge for value of the yield far from the par yield.	                                                                                                28 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CORRECTIONS TO MODIFIED DURATION	0
In addition to such specific patterns, the context of the disclosure of confidential information might also be relevant, as the means of disclosure (e.g. information sent via email or on paper), number of addressees (e.g. depending on the confidential information in question, the greater the number of addressees the greater the risk of an individual institution being identified), timing (e.g. the risk that the institution will be identifiable may be higher when the information is disclosed soon after the event it relates to). The mitigation of the above factors could decrease the risk of identifying individual institutions being identified from summary or collective information.	Thus, it seems appropriate to consider specific patterns and the context of disclosure before disclosing confidential information. However, this approach is just a complementary precautionary measure, which in practice could be redundant as the fact that collective information relates to more than one institution already significantly diminishes the risk that an individual institution will be identified as a result of disclosure. Nonetheless, the existence of this precautionary measure could itself lead to a reduction in the sample of institutions which participate in the summary information from three to two.	0

22. For the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD for each considered downturn period         identified in accordance with Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn],         institutions should use one of the three types of approaches set out in Section 5, Section 6         and Section 7 of these guidelines in accordance with the hierarchy set out in paragraphs 23         to 25 below.	23. Where institutions have sufficient and relevant loss data to conduct the impact analysis set         out in paragraph 27, they should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn         period in accordance with Section 5 of these guidelines. For this purpose, institutions         should ensure that the relevant loss data is available during the considered downturn         period as well as during an appropriate period before and after the considered downturn         period.	0

97. The rationale for this approach is that the creditworthiness of the counterparty, and thus the     ECL anticipated upon initial recognition, is taken into account in the pricing of credit at that     time. It follows, then, that a post-origination increase in credit risk may not be fully     compensated by the interest rate charged, and, as a consequence, credit institutions should     carefully consider whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk 30. If so, the     lending exposure should be subject to lifetime ECL measurement.	98. In order to consider whether an exposure has suffered a significant increase in credit risk and     the measurement of required 12-month ECL and lifetime ECL, credit institutions should have     in place sound governance, systems and controls, in accordance with the principles specified     in these guidelines. Unless already established, credit institutions should implement systems     that are capable of handling and systematically assessing the large amounts of information     that will be required to judge whether or not particular lending exposures or groups of     lending exposures exhibit a significant increase in credit risk, and to measure lifetime ECL     where that is the case. Parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to Directive 2013/36/EU     should ensure that the approach is consistent across the group. This should include, in     particular, putting in place processes to ensure that forecasts of economic conditions in     different jurisdictions and economic sectors are reviewed and approved by a credit     institution’s senior management, and that the process, controls and economic assumptions     around developing forecasts and linking these to expectations of credit loss are consistent     across the group. The need for consistency should not be interpreted as a requirement that     the practice be identical across a group. On the contrary, within a consistent framework there     may be differences across jurisdictions and products, depending for instance on the     availability of data. These differences should be well documented and justified.	0

The concept and application of the materiality threshold have been specified in the RTS on the materiality threshold for past due exposures. However, it was necessary to give additional guidance both for institutions and their competent authorities on how to apply the conditions included in these RTS in a manner that is sufficiently transparent and prudent. In particular, it has been specified that institutions may use lower thresholds than those specified by competent authorities as additional indications of unlikeliness to pay. It has to be stressed, however, that in any case institutions are required to apply the threshold in line with the conditions specified in the RTS, especially regarding the concept and structure of the threshold and the calculation of the amount it applies to.	2.3 Indications of unlikeliness to pay	0

The assessment criteria, underlying assumptions and implications should be aligned with the          RAF as well as with the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP).16	0

      (A) mortgages; and (B) consumer credits and overdrafts on current accounts. In accordance       with Article 1(2) of the final draft RTS on economic downturn, the economic downturn should       be identified for each type of exposure, where the latter should be understood in the sense of       Article 142(2) of the CRR (i.e. as exposures that are homogeneously managed).	      Therefore, in this example (where it is assumed that all three products are homogeneously       managed), for both calibration segments the institution should analyse the impact of       downturn periods identified in accordance with the RTS by considering the following economic       factors:	0

Costs: As with option 2.1, this option would not achieve full convergence of practices across credit institutions and Member States, because it would depend on the ability of the credit institutions and the competent authorities to apply the guidelines in a proportionate manner consistently. However, there might be more harmonisation than in option 2.1, since, for the simpler/less complex credit institutions, the same requirements will be applied, leading to further convergence of practices across credit institutions and Member States.	In addition, the application of criteria for the identification of smaller/less complex credit institutions may increase the risk of introducing thresholds to be mechanically applied in	0
According to Article 178(1) of the CRR the definition of default may be applied at the level of an individual credit facility only in the case of retail exposures. As retail exposures are defined differently for the IRB Approach and the Standardised Approach it is necessary to clarify the possible scope of application of the default definition at the facility level. The proposed clarification provides that institutions that use the IRB Approach may apply the definition of default at the level of an individual facility for retail exposures as defined in Article 147(5) of the CRR. Additionally, the definition of default may be applied at individual facility level for purchased corporate receivables treated as retail exposures in accordance with Article 153(6) of the CRR. Institutions that use the Standardised Approach may apply the definition of default at the level of an individual facility for all exposures that meet the criteria specified in Article 123 of the CRR even if some of those exposures, for example mortgage loans, are assigned to different exposure classes for the purpose of assignment of risk weight. This approach will allow consistent treatment of an obligor for the purpose of default identification even if various types of products are extended to this obligor.	The level of application of the default definition for retail exposures should be based on the internal risk management practices of the institution. However, if an institution decided to use different levels of application of the definition of default for different types of retail exposures, the requirements of the CRR regarding default of an obligor might not be fully met. In particular, where the definition of default is used at the obligor level, default of any exposure of an obligor should result in default of all other exposures of this obligor. Where, however, some exposures of such an obligor are assessed at the individual facility level, default on one of these exposures would not result in default of all the obligor’s exposures. In order to avoid such a situation it is proposed that where institutions decide to use different levels of application of the definition of default for different types of retail exposures they should provide evidence that there are no or a very limited number of situations where the same clients are subject to different definitions of default at different levels of application.	0

   204. All immovable property collateral should be valued on the basis of market value or       mortgage lending value, as specified under Article 229 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.       Movable property should be valued at its market value.	   205. For movable property, credit institutions should, in accordance with the requirements of       Article 199(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, periodically assess the liquidity of the       property. If there is material volatility in the market prices, the institution should       demonstrate that the valuation of the collateral is sufficiently conservative.	0
174. Credit institutions should adopt, document and adhere to sound policies, procedures and          controls for assessing and measuring loss allowances and write-off on NPEs in accordance          with the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting for expected          credit losses. Credit institutions should back-test their loss allowance estimations against          actual losses.	      175. These methodologies should also include policies and procedures on write-offs and          recoveries as defined in the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and          accounting for expected credit losses. The policy on write-offs should include indicators used          to assess expectations of recovery and detailed information on those exposures that have          been written off but are still subject to enforcement activity.	0
Threshold for the sale of credit obligations	Where an institution sells credit obligations due to a decrease in their credit quality or the loss on that sale is otherwise related to the credit quality of the obligations, the institution should analyse the materiality of the economic loss. If the economic loss is material this should be considered an indication of default. The assessment looked at the following options:	0
21. A significant number of respondents disagreed with the proposal in the CP not to include registered     AISPs. Some respondents suggested that these providers should also be monitoring fraud and that,     as new providers, it was important for them to report. However, most respondents agreed that     these providers could not report any fraudulent payment transactions data and that including     them would therefore require a change in the scope of the GL, which is limited to fraudulent     payment transactions.	22. Having assessed these responses, the EBA remains of the view that, for the purpose of these GL,     registered AISPs remain excluded from the requirement to report on ‘means of payment’ in     accordance with Article 96(6) PSD2. For overall supervisory purposes, statistical data from     registered AISPs may be relevant to CAs, independently from this reporting.	0

In order to ensure that the default definition is specified correctly and applied consistently to relevant types of exposures it has been specified in the guidelines that the documentation related to the application of the definition of default should include a detailed description of the operationalisation of all indications of default. In particular, it should describe the processes, sources of information and responsibilities for the identification of particular indications of default, including automatic mechanisms and manual processes.	As any changes in the definition of default are likely to result in structural breaks in historical data institutions should keep a register of all current and past versions of the default definition, starting at least from the date of application of these guidelines. If more than one definition of default is used in a banking group the scope of application of each definition should be clearly specified.	0

Recital 16 of the Directive mentions that consumers would benefit most from information that is concise, standardised and easy to understand, and makes comparing different PSPs easy. However, the tools made available to consumers to compare payment account offers would not have a positive impact if the time invested in going through lengthy lists of fees for different offers outweighs the benefit of choosing the offer that represents the best value. Therefore, the Directive sets out that, at this stage, terminology should only be standardised for the terms and definitions of the most representative payment account-related services within Member States. Following this step, a Union-level standardisation of terminology will take place for the services that are common to at least a majority of Member States. On that basis, the Directive focuses on ensuring that, in future, consumers will be given information in Fee Information Documents (FID) and Statements of Fees (SoF) that relates to the most representative services linked to a payment account in that Member State. The aim of this measure is to avoid the risk of an excessive amount of information being provided and to facilitate swifter implementation.	Article 3 of the Directive requires Member States to determine a provisional list of at least 10 and no more than 20 of the most representative services linked to a payment account that are subject to a fee and are offered by at least one PSP at national level. When determining their national list, Article 3(2) of the Directive stipulates that: ‘Member States shall have regard to the services that:	0

9.   A draft Consultation Paper on the Guidelines was published in February 2017 for a three-month      consultation period, which closed on 16 May 2017. The EBA received 12 responses from various      market participants, such as PSPs, trade associations and consumer associations. These      respondents raised 59 distinct issues.	10. The EBA assessed the responses from the consultation and made changes to the Guidelines     where relevant. The Feedback table in Chapter 4.2 (pages 22 to 42) provides an exhaustive and     comprehensive list of all the responses and their respective analysis by the EBA. The Rationale     section below summarises the subset of the key issues raised by respondents, and changes     made to the Guidelines.	0
B. Policy objectives	The objective of the guidelines is to establish the convergence of institutions’ assessment of whether an exposure constitutes a particularly high risk in the sense of Article 128(3) CRR. Divergent practices of institutions and supervisors regarding the specification of types of exposures that should be considered as particularly high risk may lead to a non-level playing field among institutions, as well as to unjustified variability of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) in the SA. Member States and institutions are expected to enhance the comparability of own funds requirements.	0

d. threshold for the diminished financial obligation to be specified by institutions.	The reasoning behind the assessment of the policy options in this field is very similar to that presented under the options related to the sale of credit obligations. Here, the preferred option is option c. In order to assess whether restructuring arrangements lead to diminished financial obligations institutions should compare the present value of the expected cash flows before the changes in the terms and conditions of the contract and the present value of the expected cash flows based on the new arrangement, both discounted using the original effective interest rate, and assess whether the difference between them is material. Institutions should set a threshold in terms of this difference as a percentage of the present value of expected cash flows before the application of restructuring arrangements. If the percentage is higher than the threshold as specified by the institution the exposures should be considered defaulted.	0

19. There was broad agreement amongst the respondents to the draft Guidelines. However, a     number of respondents commented that the Guidelines should be more high-level so as to     retain the flexibility, as intended in the MCD, for MS to give effect to the provisions of the     MCD. In contrast, other respondents commented that the draft Guidelines were not detailed     enough; and that some of the terms were vague and should therefore be defined, including     for example, requests for a definition of “payment difficulties”. In addition, some     respondents commented that the EBA does not have a mandate to issue these guidelines.	20. Some respondents called for the Guidelines to be amended to only include consumers in     payment difficulties whilst other respondents called for the Guidelines to be expanded to     include consumers in “expected mortgage payment difficulties”.	0

It is noted that the dB (equation 3) in the equation 13 should be consistent with the change in value of the bond, with respect the change in the interest rate. Finally, it is noted that the formula in Eq. 14 and Eq. 10 are represented with Δ and Γ (equations	5 and 6) computed as respect the change value of the price of the Bond (dB, in equation 3). Clearly those Greeks can be valued also as respect the change in value of interest rate, because we know that C = f[B(r)].	0

Background and rationale Funding conditions for credit institutions have been significantly affected by the global financial crisis. Credit and interbank markets have remained impaired as a result of the strong links between credit institutions and sovereigns, as well as the uncertainties over asset quality and the sustainability of some credit institutions’ business models. Credit institutions have responded to this situation by making changes to their balance-sheet structure and the way they fund themselves.	0

1. This document contains guidelines issued pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EU)    No 1093/20101. In accordance with Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, competent    authorities and financial institutions must make every effort to comply with the guidelines.	2. Guidelines set the EBA view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European System    of Financial Supervision or of how Union law should be applied in a particular area. Competent    authorities as defined in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 to whom guidelines apply    should comply by incorporating them into their practices as appropriate (e.g. by amending their    legal framework or their supervisory processes), including where guidelines are directed    primarily at institutions.	0
             c)        how remuneration policies have been implemented in practice, including in                        particular the criteria for variable remuneration where variable remuneration                        is granted.	2.2.   Before being allowed to offer banking products or services to consumers, relevant persons        should be clearly informed in a simple and transparent manner of the remuneration        policies and practices that are applicable to them.	0
31. Against this background, the EBA decided not to amend the content of the guideline but     decided to merge Guidelines 2.1 and 2.2 for greater clarity. Regarding the scope of the type     of staff covered, the EBA confirms that institutions will be required to a keep a record of     remuneration policies and practices only for relevant persons, which the Guidelines define as     any natural person working for an institution and who is a) directly offering or providing     banking products or services to consumers or b) directly or indirectly managing a person     referred to in point a).

The guidelines are aimed primarily at reducing NPEs on banks’ balance sheets by providing supervisory guidance to ensure that credit institutions effectively manage NPEs and forborne exposures (FBEs) on their balance sheets. The aim is to achieve a sustainable reduction of NPEs on credit institutions’ balance sheets by means of the institutions’ own NPE strategies, which would prove beneficial from both micro and macro perspectives. The guidelines are written from a prudential perspective but also taking into account the pressing need to ensure that consumers who have taken out loans are treated fairly at every stage of the loan life cycle. To that end, the guidelines draw attention specifically to provisions under the EU directives and relevant EBA guidelines relating to consumers of which credit institutions need to be cognisant when managing NPEs.	The development and operationalisation of an NPE strategy is the core building block of the guidelines for banks’ NPE management. The NPE strategy should be built on an assessment of the operating environment, should set out time-bound, credible yet ambitious reduction targets and should consider all available strategic options to reduce NPEs. The guidelines outline the proportionate approach to the key elements of governance and operations in relation to an NPE workout framework, covering aspects related to steering and decision-making, the NPE operating model, the internal control framework and NPE monitoring processes. Credit institutions with gross NPL ratios at a level of 5% or above should establish an NPE strategy, as part of their overall strategy, and related governance and operational arrangements. Effective governance covers all the responsibilities that banks have, including treating customers fairly.	0
      Credit institutions should adopt, document and adhere to policies which include sound       methodologies, procedures and controls for assessing and measuring credit risk on all lending       exposures. The measurement of allowances should build upon those methodologies and result       in the appropriate and timely recognition of ECL in accordance with the applicable accounting       framework.	23      Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU and EBA Guidelines on Internal Governance (GL 44).	0
Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR states that, ‘to the extent a rating system is expected to deliver realised LGDs at a constant level by grade or pool over time, institutions shall make adjustments to their estimates of risk parameters by grade or pool to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn’.	The following interpretations were considered:	0
1.2.   For the purposes of Guideline 1.1, the competent authority should report only payment        transactions that have been initiated and executed (including acquired where applicable) by        payment service providers (including card based payment instrument issuers where        applicable). The competent authority should not report data on payment transactions that,        however linked to any of the circumstances referred to in Guideline 1.1, have not been        executed and have not resulted in a transfer of funds in accordance with PSD2 provisions.	1.3.   The competent authority should report all payment transactions and fraudulent payment        transactions in accordance with the following:	0
9. These guidelines clarify that institutions should make use of their clients’ consolidated financial    statements 8 when assessing connections based on control. For clients to which the EU accounting    rules do not apply (e.g. natural persons, central governments and clients that prepare    consolidated accounts in accordance with the accounting rules of a third country), the guidelines    provide a non-exhaustive list of criteria and indicators of control. This list is divided into two    different sets: the first set consists of criteria that always constitute a control relationship among    clients; the second set includes examples of indicators that should be considered by institutions in    their assessment, as any of these indicators might constitute a control relationship among clients.	10.In addition, the guidelines clarify the concept of ‘single risk’ and also that the burden of proof is    on the institution to demonstrate that, despite the existence of a control relationship among    clients, those clients, by way of exception, do not constitute a single risk.	0

The potential for mis-selling and consumers experiencing detriment in         retail financial services is, amongst others, a function of the institutions’ market share more         than of their size or complexity. In addition, market shares in retail banking can change quite         dynamically over time.	0
14. Regarding the coverage of remuneration elements, remuneration of staff selling retail     banking products consists of monetary and non-monetary elements. According to a study     conducted for the EU Commission’s DG Internal Market, non-financial incentives tend to be     more long-term oriented, strengthen the retention of staff and provide the supplier with the     possibility of using tax advantages32. By nature, they are less transparent to consumers than     financial incentives. Although it is difficult to precisely estimate the proportion of nonmonetary elements in staff’s total remuneration packages, for staff selling financial products     in the EU it is estimated to lie between 1% and 2% of total remuneration. Based on this     analysis, it is preferred that these Guidelines cover monetary and non-monetary     remuneration elements to restrict circumvention and facilitate effectively achieving the     policy objectives stated above (Option 2.2). This approach is consistent with remuneration     requirements for sales staff in other areas of financial services33,34.	15. Regarding proportionality in the application of these Guidelines, requiring compliance with     these Guidelines only from a specific category of institutions, for instance systemically     important institutions (SIIs), would be inappropriate and insufficient to address the risks	0
72.The validation framework should include the following four core elements:	                                                                                                       21 GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES	0
        in GBP. However, where the host DGS has the capability to make payouts in several         currencies, and where contracts with depositors or the information provided to them in         accordance with Directive 2014/49/EU allowed payouts in CHF, depositors who had         accounts in Swiss francs could be repaid in francs.	43. Where there is a need for a currency exchange, the rate to be applied should be the spot rate     published by the central bank of the home DGS’s Member State on the day of the     determination of unavailability of deposits in a given institution.	0
9. Unless otherwise specified, terms used and defined in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and    Directive (EU) 36/2013 have the same meaning in these guidelines.	                                                                                                19 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	0
    27.In summary, Example 3 illustrates that, in cases of LGD models based on risk drivers sensitive        to the economic cycle, the impact on the current capital requirements of an upcoming        economic upturn (or downturn) is twofold: (i) the impact stemming from the expected lower        (or higher) realised economic losses per facility (in the event of a downturn, this is covered by        the downturn LGD estimation by grade) and (ii) the impact stemming from the migrations of        facilities to lower (or higher) LTV bands.	    28.It is indeed true that the loss rates in the higher LTV bands already reflect the expected realised        LGDs under upcoming downturn conditions. The expected realised loss (in contrast to the loss        rates) will, however, be higher, due to the higher proportion of facilities that migrate to the        higher LTV bands.	0

    26.Paragraph 17 of the GL relates to the second sentence of Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR, which        requires that institutions make adjustments to their estimates of risk parameters by grade or        pool to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn if a rating system is expected to        deliver realised LGDs at a constant level by grade or pool over time. The EBA considers that        this provision is meant to ensure that the capital impact that stems from the migrations        between facility grades and pools (e.g. in cases where risk drivers sensitive to the economic        cycle are used) does not lead over time to an over- or underestimation of the LGDs appropriate        for an economic downturn. This provision, however, targets migrations caused by changes in        the economic cycle. Structural changes over time in a portfolio under consideration (which        might also be caused by changes in economic conditions, e.g. due to tightened underwriting        standards) are a matter of representativeness and should be treated in accordance with        section 4 of the GL on PD and LGD. This entails in particular that institutions should assume        that no exposures would have been newly added to a calibration segment and that no        exposures would have left a calibration segment due to orderly termination of the contract,        when considering the likely distribution of the current portfolio affected by the relevant        downturn period.	                                                                                                  17 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN	0
fundamental role in creating economic growth and providing employment in the Union market (see recital 44 of the CRR).	Paragraph 6 sets out specific criteria in which equity exposures should be considered as potentially constituting exposures that have a high risk of loss. In particular, equity exposures should be considered whether to be classified as high risk if (i) the institution holds any other debt exposure to the same issuer and this other exposure is risk-weighted at 150%, or (ii) the debt of any such issuer would receive a 150% risk weight if these debt obligations were exposures of the institution.	0
107.   Institutions should verify on a regular basis that all forborne non-performing exposures    are classified as default and subject to distressed restructuring. Institutions should also    analyse on a regular basis the forborne performing exposures in order to determine whether    any of them fulfils the indication of unlikeliness to pay as specified in Article 178(3)(d) of    Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in paragraphs 49 to 55.	108.   Control mechanisms should ensure that the relevant information is used in the default    identification process immediately after being obtained.

                          7. The term ‘calibration target’ is not used in the CRR. However, where it is used in this section it                              refers to the value that is considered for the purpose of calibration in accordance with                              paragraph 161 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation. It should be noted that the specification                              of a calibration target in this sense and the estimation might coincide where institutions use                              LGD models (in the sense of Article 174 of the CRR) that assign exposures to facility grades or                              pools without providing for individual estimates of loss. In this case, the LGD model just	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     7 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN	0

              -        Apart from the previous adjustments, the guidelines request that an additional                        correction factor is considered in order to reflect any significant transaction costs                        that the early payment of the callable bond might produce, as well as behavioural                        factors, which would reflect the fact that some of the options’ buyers might decide                        not to execute the option despite being in the money.

The aggregate volume of the (short and long) gross/non-netted positions under the durationbased approach in the sample is EUR 7,223 billion (not shown). For both short and long positions, about 65% of the positions fall under maturity zone 1, 12% under maturity zone 2 and the remaining 23% under maturity zone 3 (not shown). 20	The corresponding own funds requirements with the (short and long) positions under the duration-based approach are EUR 1,201 million (not shown). The share of own funds requirements for these positions under the duration-based approach is about 17% of the total corresponding own funds requirements under both the maturity-based and duration-based approaches. This is reasonable given that the share of positions under the duration-based approach is about 11% of the total positions including both the maturity-based and durationbased approaches. The overview suggests that the guidelines would have a greater impact on DK, FR, UK, IT and NO, i.e. jurisdictions where the institutions have a relatively large volume of (long and short) positions under the duration-based approach.	0

The scenario specified for the purpose of the QIS corresponds to the provisions included in the GL in paragraphs 41 to 48. One difference is that, while in the GL the threshold for evaluating the materiality of the credit-related economic loss should be set by institutions at a level not higher than 5%, and so the 5% acts as a cap for the threshold, the QIS tested exactly this upper bound. A second difference is that in the final GL additional clarification has been added on the fact that that internal sales as well as traditional securitisation with significant transfer of risk should be treated as sales of credit obligations, while in the consultation paper this was not fully clear and could have been interpreted otherwise by the institutions participating in the QIS. Considering those two differences we can interpret the results of the QIS as a lower bound for the potential impact.	The results of the QIS in the area of the sale of credit obligations are limited due to the fact that most of the institutions participating in the QIS do not sell credit obligations and even if they do they usually do not use a quantitative threshold to assess the materiality of loss. The quantitative part of the QIS confirms the observed practices, showing a very small impact in terms of capital requirements for both SA and IRB institutions (an increase in capital adequacy ratio of around	0
The present guidelines are consistent with the Standards on the supervisory framework for measuring and controlling large exposures issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in April 2014. 3 They are, however, more detailed and also include aspects that are not considered in the Basel standards (e.g. an alternative approach for exposures to central governments, the relation between interconnectedness through control and economic dependency).	3     http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs283.htm	0

Consumer behavioural research shows that consumers are overoptimistic when buying new products and believe that they are unlikely to incur certain fees in the future. While certain services might be available to all consumers, they may only be used by a small proportion of consumers, but very often, and therefore are among the most common services attracting a fee. As suggested above, this might be the case for the fees that apply when a customer exceeds the number of transactions covered by the account maintenance fee or when there are insufficient funds in the account. Competent authorities should consider whether, based on their experience of the national market, the potential for the consumer or segments of consumers to incur such costs in future, and possibly suffer detriment, merits the service’s inclusion on the provisional list, rather than its exclusion.	0

This should include an adequate assessment of the borrower’s financial       situation, based on sufficient information and taking into account relevant factors such as       the debt-servicing capacity and overall indebtedness of the borrower or the       property/project.	   6.2.4         Standardised forbearance products and decision trees	0

The definition of default influences own funds requirements both under the IRB Approach and under the Standardised Approach. In the case of the IRB Approach it is the basis for estimation of risk parameters and therefore influences risk weights and expected loss calculation for both defaulted and non-defaulted exposures. In the case of the Standardised Approach the definition of default is the basis for the assignment of exposures to the class of exposures in default in line with Article 127 of the CRR.	As certain choices in the application of the default definition may have a significant impact on own funds requirements it is important to ensure a level playing field across institutions in the entire EU. Therefore, these guidelines provide detailed guidance on the application of various aspects of the definition of default, including the past due criterion as an indication of default, indications of unlikeliness to pay, specific aspects of the application of the definition of default for retail exposures, application of the default definition in a banking group, treatment of external data and criteria for a return to non-defaulted status. It is expected that the harmonisation of practices will not only increase comparability of risk parameters and own funds requirements but also reduce the burden for cross-border institutions of complying with different requirements in different Member States.	0
Scope of the Guidelines	8.   While a large majority of respondents supported the objectives of these Guidelines, two      respondents indicated that the definition of remuneration should be expanded so as also to      cover performance management systems. Several other respondents, by contrast, expressed      concerns about the wide definition of remuneration, in particular the inclusion of nonmonetary benefits, which in their view creates difficulties for institutions to demonstrate      compliance at the level of the individual employee. Consequently, these respondents      suggested narrowing down the definition of remuneration to monetary remuneration only,      focusing on the variable remuneration.	0
   120. Monitoring the recovery rates from foreclosure and other legal proceedings should help       credit institutions to reliably assess whether the decision to foreclose will provide a higher       net present value than pursuing a forbearance option. The data regarding the recovery rates       from foreclosures should be monitored on an ongoing basis and feed into potential       amendments to credit institutions’ strategies for handling their debt recovery/legal       portfolios.	   121. Credit institutions should also monitor the average duration of legal procedures recently       completed and the average amounts recovered (including related recovery costs) from these       completed procedures.	0
Article 3(2) of the Directive mandates the European Banking Authority (EBA) to issue guidelines to ensure the sound application of the criteria for Member States to establish those provisional lists. The Directive mentions that Member States shall have regard to the services that a) are most commonly used by consumers in relation to their payment account and b) generate the highest cost for consumers, both overall as well as per unit.	The guidelines set out how the designated competent authorities should apply the criteria, what factors they should take into consideration, how they should report their list of the most representative services to the EBA and to the European Commission, and what supporting data should be obtained. The guidelines mention that competent authorities should first assess the services that could potentially be included in their provisional list by ranking them against each of the criteria specified in Article 3(2). The EBA considers that competent authorities may apply these criteria independently as the criteria do not need to be used cumulatively. Given the differences in services and related pricing structures that exist between payment services providers and between Member States, it is appropriate that competent authorities apply the criteria in a way that is relevant to the specificities of local markets. For this task, competent authorities may make use of data from a wide range of sources, provided the data is reliable. Competent authorities should respond to the European Commission and to the EBA using the template provided.	0
    54.If no sufficient data are available to calibrate downturn LGD in accordance with the proposed        policy described above, institutions should aim to calibrate their downturn LGDs based on the        estimated impact of the downturn period under consideration. However, institutions should        estimate that impact by applying either a haircut or an extrapolation approach. Where        institutions have observed data for only a certain intermediate parameter or risk driver        reflecting the impact of the downturn period under consideration, institutions should estimate        the realised historical LGDs (which they have not observed) affected by the downturn period        under consideration by combining the observed impact on the intermediate parameter or risk        driver with the estimated impact of other intermediate parameters resulting from a haircut        and/or extrapolation approach. As stated above, both approaches can be used to estimate        unobserved realised LGDs or intermediate parameters or risk drivers from the past.	    55.The haircut approach provides an estimate indirectly by adjusting (i.e. applying a haircut to)        the input variables of the LGD model. Thus, a haircut approach relies on the functional        relationship that is established in the model between realised losses and certain input        parameters. In particular, in order to apply a haircut approach, this functional relationship        needs to describe the dependency of the LGD estimate on several risk drivers, of which at least        one is an economic factor. This might especially be the case when collateral values are used as        risk drivers . The downturn LGD estimate is then computed by applying the LGD model where        the above-mentioned economic factor (or even factors) is/are adjusted to reflect the level        observed in the downturn period under consideration. The haircut approach may equally be        applied to intermediate risk parameters or risk drivers.	0
i.e. an LTV metric where house price index (HPI) variations affect the value of the collateral and          hence the denominator of the LTV metric. Thus, this risk driver is sensitive to the economic cycle          (as defined by the economic factor HPI).          In order to illustrate the impact of migrations caused by the economic cycle via such a risk driver          on the distribution of facilities over grades and thus the final downturn LGD estimation, it is          assumed that the composition of the portfolio remains constant1. In this case, when moving into          an upturn, house prices might increase (HPI increase) and, since the LTV is affected by such          increases, facilities tend to migrate to better LTV grades (i.e. LTVs tend to decrease). In the          illustration below, the yellow band represents LTVs of 100% or higher, the grey band represents          LTVs between 80% and 100%, the red band represents LTVs between 40% and 80%, and the blue          band represents LTVs between 0% and 40%:	         In this example, it is also assumed that the downturn LGD estimates for the LTV buckets are          quantified using the methodologies described in section 5, i.e. based on the impact on loss data          available for the downturn period under consideration.                                                             %#                                             LTV BUCKET                DT LGD                                                          FACILITIES                                                 [0,40)      15%        10%                                                [40,80)      50%        25%                                               [80, 100)     30%        35%                                                [100, +)     5%         43%                                                 PORTFOLIO DT LGD      26.65%	0
12.As with all EBA guidelines, these guidelines should be read holistically with the understanding that    the examples provided are not all-inclusive and that a checklist approach to applying these    guidelines is not intended. While these guidelines are to be applied for the assessment of credit    risk from, and the measurement of ECL on, lending exposures under the applicable accounting    framework, they do not set out principles and expectations targeted at specific categories of loans    such as corporate, retail and project finance. In this regard, certain aspects of the guidelines may    be more applicable to the individual credit assessment of a large corporate borrower, while other    aspects may be more relevant to collective assessments of a particular group of retail customers.

2. According to Article 9(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU, the competent authorities shall require that    each recovery plan includes a framework of indicators established by the institution which    identifies the points at which appropriate actions referred to in the plan may be taken. The    framework of indicators should be included in the recovery plans developed pursuant to the    regulatory technical standard on the content of recovery plans developed pursuant to    Article 5(10) of Directive 2014/59/EU.	3. Such indicators shall be agreed by the competent authorities when making the assessment of    recovery plans in accordance with Articles 6 and 8 of Directive 2014/59/EU, as further    specified in the EBA regulatory technical standard on the assessment of recovery plans    developed pursuant to Article 6(8) of Directive 2014/59/EU. The indicators may be of a    qualitative or quantitative nature relating to the institution’s financial position and shall be    capable of being monitored easily. The competent authorities shall ensure that institutions put    in place appropriate arrangements for the regular monitoring of the indicators.	0

Therefore, full alignment could be achieved by specifying that all nonperforming exposures should be treated as defaulted (option a). However, this rule might lead to unintended consequences and an excessively high default rate and cure rate. In particular, where institutions are allowed to use 180 days past due instead of 90 in accordance with Article 178(1)(b) of the CRR, this discretion would in practice be overruled by the alignment with the supervisory reporting framework, which does not allow such discretion.	0
Paragraph 27 requires institutions to conduct an impact assessment related to the calibration segment under consideration. For this, the construction of several yearly time series is required. Several grouping options have been considered: use of the date of default, the date of the main recovery or the date of return to non-defaulted status or close work out process.

Date of application	33.

Those previous guidelines define appropriate downturn conditions as those in which relevant drivers of default rates are consistent with conditions in which credit losses for the supervisory exposure class are expected to be substantially higher than average. This framework put an emphasis on the correlation between default rates and recovery rates; in fact, if no material dependencies between default rates and recovery rates are identified, the downturn LGD estimates may be based on the long-run average LGD.	0

With regard to those securitisation transactions meeting the conditions for achieving SRT in      accordance with points (a) or (b) of Article 243(2) or Article 244(2) of Regulation (EU) No      575/2013, competent authorities should conduct a comprehensive review of SRT in      accordance with Title III, paragraphs 4 to 10 of these Guidelines, where any of the following      circumstances contained in the non-exhaustive list below applies:	0
The main objective of the current guidelines is to incorporate into the current duration-based calculation of general risk a correction term for the modified duration. In other words, the objective is to correct the calculation of the modified duration so that the estimation of the priceyield sensitivity and of associated own funds requirements internalises the prepayment risk inherent to debt instruments, e.g. debt instruments with embedded options. This correction is expected to provide a more accurate estimation of price sensitivity and adjust the methodology for the potential underestimation of losses and overestimation of gains.	16   Below it is shown that the own funds requirements would actually decrease when the prepayment risk is taken into account.	0

24. In addition to the responses received to the public consultation and following input regarding     the potential supervisory structures that Member States might adopt in line with Article 5 of     Directive 2014/17/EU, the EBA decided to clarify how the guidelines apply where there is a     competent authority as defined in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 (‘EBA     authority’) which has responsibility under Article 5(3) for cooperating with other authorities     designated as competent for applying the Directive.	25. To that end, and as stated in paragraph 6 (a) of the Addressee Section of the Guidelines, the     Guidelines will apply to EBA authorities alone, and only to the extent that the EBA authority     has been designated as competent for ensuring the application and enforcement of those     provisions of Directive 2014/17/EU to which the Guidelines relate.	0

The guidelines consist of two sections. The first section aims to clarify the notions of investments in venture capital firms and private equity as referred to in Article 128(2) CRR; the second section specifies the types of exposures other than those listed in points (a) to (d) that should be considered as high risk (and under which circumstances) by way of application of Article 128(3) CRR.	Regarding the first section, it should be noted that the outlined clarification is not within the mandate for the guidelines that the CRR provides, but that the inclusion of this clarification, as an own initiative contribution, was considered helpful by the EBA.	0
On the one hand, if any of the indications of default specified in Article 178(1) of the CRR occurs on a joint credit obligation of two or more obligors all other joint credit obligations of the same set of obligors and all individual exposures to those obligors should be considered defaulted. Exceptions from this rule have been specified in order to account for situations where the delay in payment of a joint credit obligation results from a dispute between the individual obligors and where a joint credit obligation is an immaterial part of the total obligations of an individual obligor. Moreover, the contagious effect of this default should not automatically spread to other joint credit obligations of individual obligors with other individuals or entities that are not involved in the exposure that has initially been defaulted.	On the other hand, if any of the indications of default specified in Article 178(1) of the CRR occurs on an exposure to an individual obligor the contagious effect of this default should not automatically spread to any joint credit obligations of that obligor with other individuals or entities. Nevertheless, the institution should assess such exposures for possible indications of unlikeliness to pay related to the default of one of the obligors. If, however, all the individual obligors are in defaulted status their joint credit obligations should also be considered defaulted.	0

29. Many respondents commented on the reporting burden placed on PSPs by the GL, in particular for     those PSPs that do not currently report under the ECB Regulation on payment statistics. A number     of respondents were of the view that the burden was disproportionate, in terms of both the     frequency of reporting and the level of detail required. This led a large number of respondents to     argue that it would be particularly challenging to have such reporting up and running from H2 2018     as proposed in the CP.	Frequency	0

Reporting requirements	3. According to Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, competent authorities must notify    the EBA as to whether they comply or intend to comply with these guidelines, or otherwise    with reasons for non-compliance, by ([dd.mm.yyyy]). In the absence of any notification by this    deadline, competent authorities will be considered by the EBA to be non-compliant.    Notifications should be sent by submitting the form available on the EBA website to    compliance@eba.europa.eu with the reference ‘EBA/GL/201x/xx’. Notifications should be    submitted by persons with appropriate authority to report compliance on behalf of their    competent authorities. Any change in the status of compliance must also be reported to EBA.	0
It is acknowledged that the Directive provides competent authorities with the necessary flexibility to compile a provisional list that reflects their national market. While these guidelines consider t h e competent authorities’ use of the criteria, Member States are required to ‘’have regard’‘ to the criteria. As such, the EBA recognises that other criteria may be considered pertinent by competent authorities. Given the objective of improving the comparability of services across Member States, the EBA considers that additional criteria may be relevant but only exceptionally and when required by specific market conditions.	Competent authorities should consider including as a service the provision of the account itself, payment or transactional services, or penalties and charges that are levied based on the customer’s account behaviour or circumstances, including interest rates for overdraft facilities and overrunning. Competent authorities should note that the provisional list is not supposed to be a comprehensive list of all the services that might be available and their associated fees.	0

Addressees	13. These guidelines are addressed to competent authorities as defined in point (i) of Article 4(2)     of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.	0
To foster convergent practices, these guidelines (i) give guidance on how information should be provided in summary or collective form and (ii) define principle-based factors (i.e. number of institutions, specific patterns and context of disclosure) which should be considered in order to ensure that the information in summary or collective form is disclosed such that individual institutions or entities cannot be identified (i.e. in an anonymised form).	The approach taken in the draft guidelines is intended to strike a balance between the need to achieve an appropriate level of convergence of practices regarding how confidential information should be provided in summary or collective form, and the need to ensure flexibility, considering that there may be many different types of confidential information as well as many different circumstances and situations in which confidential information may need to be disclosed.	0
b.   payment transactions made as a result of the payer being manipulated by the                  fraudster to issue a payment order, or to give the instruction to do so to the                  payment service provider, in good-faith, to a payment account it believes belongs                  to a legitimate payee (‘manipulation of the payer’).	1.2.   For the purposes of Guideline 1.1, the competent authority should report only payment        transactions that have been initiated and executed (including acquired where applicable) by        payment service providers (including card based payment instrument issuers where        applicable). The competent authority should not report data on payment transactions that,        however linked to any of the circumstances referred to in Guideline 1.1, have not been        executed and have not resulted in a transfer of funds in accordance with PSD2 provisions.	0

    18.The provision set out in paragraph 15 of the GL ensures that, as a general concept, an        institution needs to estimate downturn LGDs appropriate to each downturn period identified        in accordance with the RTS on economic downturn. As the approach in the RTS can lead to the        identification of multiple downturn periods, institutions need to calibrate downturn LGD and        provide the resulting LGD downturn estimates in relation to different downturn periods.        Consequently, this may require institutions to calibrate downturn LGD based on different types        of approaches (as described in section 2.5 of this Background and rationale), as loss data might        be available for some identified downturn periods, but not for others.	    19.Given that, in the case of multiple downturn periods, institutions may have to use different        approaches in order to set the calibration target, it is important to specify in detail how this        interaction should work, which will in turn specify which final downturn LGD estimates should        be selected. Therefore, three principles are laid down in the policy:	0

As with option 2.1, this option would require credit institutions to apply the guidelines in a proportionate manner, without providing more specific requirements on how to apply the requirements in different circumstances, except for smaller/less complex credit institutions for which the application of the practical expedients of IFRS 9 would be explicitly permitted. For other credit institutions, the application of the practical expedients of IFRS 9 should be limited.	Benefits: As with option 2.1, this option requires compliance in outcome, which is the application of sound credit risk and accounting practices by all credit institutions, providing freedom of means for achieving that according to the assessment of specific proportionality criteria. In addition, this option explicitly permits smaller/less complex credit institutions to apply the practical expedients of IFRS 9, and hence ensures consistent requirements for smaller/less complex credit institutions.	0
22.When evaluating the amounts, types and distributions of internal capital pursuant to Article 73    of Directive 2013/36/EU, institutions should base the contribution of IRRBB to the overall    internal capital assessment on the institution’s internal measurement systems outputs, taking    account of key assumptions and risk limits. The overall level of capital should be commensurate    with both the institution’s actual measured level of risk (including for IRRBB) and its risk    appetite, and be duly documented in its report on the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment    Process (ICAAP report).	23.Institutions should demonstrate that their internal capital is commensurate with the level of    IRRBB, taking into account the impact on internal capital of potential changes in the institution’s    economic value and future earnings resulting from changes in interest rates. Institutions are not    expected to double-count their internal capital for EV and earning measures.	0

14. The EBA has therefore amended Guideline 1 and introduced a new Guideline 1.2, which now     requires at least one of the channels for submission of complaints to be of a digital nature.	15. Taking into account that there might be divergent digital channels introduced by the CAs, the     EBA is of the view that CAs should decide on the precise choice of a digital channel. In addition,     the EBA also considers that digital channels require access to the internet, which might not be     available to all complainants, that such channels might lead to implicit costs for complainants,     and also that CAs cannot guarantee 100% availability of digital channels. Therefore, the EBA     slightly changed the wording of Guideline 1.1., which now specifies that at least one of the     channels for submission of complaints should be easily accessible for all types of complainants.	0
    may be less frequent than the calculations presented above under the heading ‘Interest rate     scenarios for ongoing internal management’.	31. Institutions should not rely on the standardised 200-basis point parallel interest rate shock     performed for the competent authority (see IRRBB 5), but should use an appropriate range of     different stress scenarios, in particular:	0

As in the above situations the criteria for default have not been met in practice, these exposures should not be treated as defaulted. Therefore, it has been clarified that when an institution identifies such a situation the exposures of this obligor should be removed from the list of defaults and should not be taken into account as defaults in the estimation of risk parameters.	   2.2.3        Exposures to central governments, local authorities and public sector         entities	0
ones provided by the Basel III framework and, in particular, with the speculative unlisted exposures and other subordinated debt, capital and equity exposures (paragraphs 50-53). In line with its prerogatives, the EBA has taken the initiative to provide, for the purposes of the present guidelines only, a definition of the notions of private equity and venture capital. This step has been taken precisely because of the lack of guidance available to the public on these notions and because the definitions are deemed necessary for providing guidance and ensuring harmonisation regarding the types of exposures that are considered as investments in venture capital and private equity. Furthermore, the EBA clarifies that the definitions apply to direct investments and whenever the look-through approach is used for exposures in the form of shares or units in CIUs, in line with the answer provided by the Commission to Q&A 2013_374.	Many of the comments made regarding the Consultation Paper have tackled the issue of the scope of the guidelines, with respondents presenting heterogeneous opinions on whether the guidelines should take a broader or a narrower view with regard to the exposure classes that should be scoped out during the identification of exposures associated with high risk. In light of these comments, the EBA has amended section 4.2 of the guidelines to provide institutions with a clearer, holistic identification scheme for exposures associated with high risk. This is in line with the mandate granted to the EBA through Article 128(3) CRR. It also takes into account empirical evidence regarding the functioning of financial institutions. As a result, the underlying logic of section 4.2 is the following: (i) paragraph 3 presents the scope of what this exercise covers (all exposure classes) with some emphasis on some specific areas; (ii) paragraph 4 presents the generic criterion of when an exposure is considered to be associated with high risk; (iii) paragraph 5 illustrates specific cases in which the generic criterion will be considered to have been met; and (iv) paragraph 6 presents other specific cases in which the generic criterion will be considered to have been met, which are specific to the equity exposure class.	0

3 months or more. For exposures under distressed restructuring the length of the probation period in use ranges from 3 months to 1 year, with almost half of the institutions using the minimum probation period of 1 year prescribed in the GL.	In the case of exposures defaulted due to the past due criterion 43% of the institutions link the start of the probation period to when the default triggers no longer apply, as prescribed in the GL. For exposures under distressed restructuring only 4% of the institutions link the start of the probation period to the latest event between the start of the restructuring measures and the default event, largely in line with what is prescribed in the GL. The most common approach (used by 33% of the institutions) is letting the probation period start when the restructuring measures are applied without checking whether this date is prior to or after the date of default or the end of any grace period.	0

The quantitative part of the QIS was designed to quantify the impact of the proposed technical policy options taking into account the various dimensions of impact as described above. The analysis was performed on a sample of 64 institutions (of which 22 used the SA, 32 used the IRB Approach and 10 reported on both SA and IRB exposures). These institutions account for 44% of the total of EU institutions’ credit risk-weighted exposures 6.	The estimation of the impact was performed by institutions on selected representative samples of specified portfolios of retail and corporate SME exposures. The representativeness of the samples selected for the analysis by the institutions may impact the accuracy of the analysis. It should also be noted that the subjectivity of institutions in interpreting and estimating the impact may affect the results of any analysis undertaken.

Guidelines outline the EBA view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European System    of Financial Supervision or of how European Union law should be applied in a particular area.    Competent authorities as defined in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 to whom    guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them into their practices as appropriate (e.g. by    amending their legal framework or their supervisory processes), including where guidelines are    directed primarily at institutions.	0
The baseline scenario can be defined in terms of supervisory rules and practices, institutions’ current practices and the regulatory environment.	The baseline scenario in terms of the supervisory expectations is specified on the basis of information exchanged among the competent authorities that participated in the relevant working groups. Based on this exchange, it can be considered that speculative investments, as well as lowquality specialised lending, are already considered in some EU jurisdictions for the purpose of identifying exposures associated with particularly high risk.	0

Among the responses in the category ‘other’, one institution mentioned that it selects       the data used in downturn estimation according to exposures that default during the       downturn period. One institution mentioned a three-step approach: (1) downturn periods       are identified if the house price index has decreased; (2) the average house price decline       during the downturn period is calculated; and (3) the recovery rate under downturn periods       is computed by subtracting the average house price decline from the usual recovery rate.       Other institutions mentioned a combination of selecting all exposures that defaulted during       the downturn period for the unsecured part of the exposure, and selecting all exposures for       which the recovery process ends during the downturn period for the secured part of the       exposure.	0
This result may seem counterintuitive; however it accurately reflects the real sensitivity stemming from a financial asset that consists of fixed cash flows with embedded optionality. Indeed, if for example we look at a callable bond whose embedded optionality is deep in the money, the Corrected Modified Duration (CMD thereafter) will be significantly lower than the MD we would observe without the optionality.	This reflects the fact that the real maturity of the bond would almost certainly be the first date on which the bond can be called; in addition, any increase in interest rate would have a negligible effect on the value of the bond due to the effect of the sold option. Both features (short time to effective maturity and nearly zero sensitivity to changes in interest rates) fully justify a lower capital requirement 1.	0

On 29 June 2012, the Euro Area Summit took an important step towards breaking the negative link between sovereigns and credit institutions. It envisaged a single supervisory mechanism and the direct use of European funds from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and European Stability Mechanism (ESM) for bank recapitalisation/bailout and resolution. However, certain credit institutions still weigh negatively on sovereigns, and vice versa. This vicious circle needs to be broken to improve the functioning of the funding markets.	Credit institutions provide valuable intermediation services to the real economy. To ensure there is stable growth in the real economy, the resilience of the banking sector must be improved. The recommendation of the EBA for a minimum 9% Core Tier 1 capital ratio for credit institutions has partly contributed to this aim. The on-going reform of the European Union regulatory regimes governing        credit     institutions     has     achieved        much      needed      clarity (Capital Requirements Directive IV/Capital Requirements Regulation package (CRD IV/CRR) – in particular its provisions regarding the liquidity regime) and will further strengthen credit institutions as it is phased in, though other important elements such as the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) remain at the negotiation stage.	0

The gamma sensitivities of the call on the bond tend to be significantly negative for values closer to the par value of the bond (6%). The gamma sensitivities of the option tends to zero the more we move far from the par yield, so gamma sensitivities for the vanilla bond and the callable bond tend to converge for value of the yield far from the par yield.	                                                                                                  27 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CORRECTIONS TO MODIFIED DURATION	0

Macroeconomic forecasts and other relevant information should be applied consistently     across portfolios where the credit risk drivers of the portfolios are affected by these     forecasts/assumptions in the same way. Furthermore, when developing ECL estimates, credit     institutions should apply their experienced credit judgement to consider their point in the     credit cycle, which may differ across the jurisdictions in which they have lending exposures.	0
E. Impacts of the technical options	Under the Standardised Approach, Article 127 of the CRR groups the unsecured parts of defaulted exposures as a specific asset class. Within this asset class the risk weight is assigned according to the ratio between the unsecured part of the exposure value and the SCRA. If the SCRA are equal to or greater than 20% of the unsecured part of the exposure value then the assigned risk weight is 100%. The assigned risk weight is 150% if the SCRA are less than 20% of the unsecured part of the exposure value. In other words, a stricter default definition might lead to a higher level of defaulted exposures in the asset class where higher risk weights are assigned, leading to higher own funds requirements.	0

Alternatively, institutions may re-compute directly the CMD by repricing the instrument after shifting the IRR by 100 b.p. In this case, no gamma correction is necessary, since the instrument is fully revalued and no delta approximation is applied. In addition, firms may also directly include the additional correction described previously in the pricing of the instrument, or treat it otherwise as a separate additional factor.	Under this second alternative, the following methodology should be applied to the CMD:	0
   7.3.2         Classification of FBEs as non-performing	   155. When granting forbearance measures to performing exposures, credit institutions should       assess whether these measures lead to a need to reclassify the exposure as non-performing.       Granting forbearance measures to NPEs does not clear their non-performing status: the       exposures should continue to be identified as non-performing for at least one year of the cure       period after the granting of the forbearance measures, as specified in Annex V to Commission       Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 and in section 7.3.3.	0
57 (148 instead of 202).	   238. In nearly 40% of LGD models, the data used in downturn estimation are selected based       on all observed defaults during the whole observation period to which an adjustment is       made, to take into account downturn conditions, whereas in 17% of models all defaults that       occurred during the downturn period are included.	0
Of course if we used the MD to estimate losses for short positions the situation would be the reverse one, so the real loss resulting from a decrease in IRR would be consistently higher than the one estimated based on the MD.	Duration-based metrics would be generally conservative for directionally-long portfolios, while they might underestimate potential losses for directionally-short portfolios. Regardless of this, the Standardised Approach does not include any adjustment to correct convexity; however, the convexity stemming from any embedded optionality should be considered in these guidelines when calculating any correction to the modified duration.	0

38.When making decisions on hedging activities, institutions should be aware of the effects of    accounting policies, but the accounting treatment should not drive their risk management    approach. The management of economic risks should therefore be a priority, and the accounting    impacts managed as a secondary concern.	39.Consolidating institutions should ensure that internal governance arrangements and processes    for the management of IRRBB are consistent and well integrated on a consolidated and a subconsolidated basis.	0
2.4 Application of the definition of default in external data The guidelines provide clarification that the requirements with regard to external data apply only to institutions that use the IRB Approach and use such data for the purpose of the estimation of risk parameters. In these situations it is important to ensure that the sample used for the purpose of the estimation of risk parameters is homogenous and representative of the institution’s portfolio, including in terms of the definition of default that was applied. For this reason institutions should assess the differences between the definitions of default used internally and in external data and their impact on the default rate.	In any case institutions should be able to demonstrate that broad equivalence with the internal definition of default has been achieved in line with Article 178(4) of the CRR. Nevertheless, it is expected that in some cases institutions will not be able to make all necessary adjustments or demonstrate that certain differences are negligible in terms of the impact on all risk parameters and own funds requirements. Therefore, it has been clarified that in this situation the requirements of Article 179(1)(f) of the CRR should apply and institutions should consider these circumstances by a larger margin of conservatism in the estimation of risk parameters.	0

Institutions should verify on a regular basis that all forborne non-performing exposures    are classified as default and subject to distressed restructuring. Institutions should also    analyse on a regular basis the forborne performing exposures in order to determine whether    any of them fulfils the indication of unlikeliness to pay as specified in Article 178(3)(d) of    Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in paragraphs 49 to 55.	0

5.5.18 of IFRS 9). A nil allowance could however occur, for example, for fully collateralised     loans (although credit institutions should be cautious when developing estimates of collateral     value, as valuation of collateral at origination may change over the life of the loan).	87. Credit institutions should adopt an active approach to assessing and measuring 12-month ECL     that enables changes in credit risk to be identified in a timely manner and hence the timely     recognition of those changes in ECL.

118.   ‘Significant’ should not be equated with statistical significance, meaning that the    assessment approach should not be based solely on quantitative analysis. For portfolios which    have a large number of individually small credits, and a rich set of relevant historical data, it    may be possible to identify ‘significant’ increases in credit risk in part by using statistical    techniques. However, for other lending exposures, that may not be feasible.	119.    ‘Significant’ should also not be judged in terms of the extent of impact on a credit    institution’s primary financial statements. Identification and disclosure of significant increases    in credit risk should be undertaken, even where an increase in credit risk defined in terms of    probability of default is unlikely to affect the allowance made — for example, because the    exposure is more than fully collateralised — to allow credit institutions to identify and    disclose such increases which are likely to be important to users seeking to understand trends    in the intrinsic credit risk of a credit institution’s lending exposures.	0

Different sources for forbearance       measures are, inter alia, the borrower using a forbearance clause embedded in a contract,       bilateral negotiation of forbearance between a borrower and a credit institution and a public       forbearance scheme extended to all borrowers in a specific situation.	0

    16.The GL clarify in paragraph 14(a) that downturn LGD should be calibrated at least at the same        level as that at which the long-run average LGD is calculated for the purpose of calibrating LGD        in accordance with paragraph 161 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation. The rationale for this        is that downturn LGD estimation should be understood as risk quantification of LGD estimates        appropriate for an economic downturn, i.e. that the downturn LGD calibration just provides a        different calibration target from long-run average LGD and sets out additional requirements        regarding the applicable MoC. Thus, if an institution considers the long-run average LGDs by        grades or pools (in line with paragraph 161(a) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation) with the        objective of calibrating LGD estimates for these grades or pools, it needs to consider the same        level for quantifying downturn LGD. If an institution considers long-run average LGDs        calculated at the level of calibration segments for the purpose of LGD calibration (in line with        Article 161(b) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation), it needs to quantify downturn LGDs for the        purpose of downturn LGD calibration at least by calibration segment.	    17.In addition paragraph 14(b) provides guidance on the use of calibration segments in downturn        LGD estimation analogous to paragraph 97 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation, which provides        guidance on the use of calibration segments for PD estimation. An institution should identify        subsets of the type of exposure under consideration as calibration segments, where exposures        in these subsets are covered by the same LGD model for assignment to facility grades but on        average show significantly different loss profiles, and where exposures in these subsets are        affected differently by downturn periods. At a minimum, banks are required to consider        material subsets of exposures covering different geographical areas/jurisdictions or industry        sectors or, in the case of retail, product types as calibration segments. The rationale for this        minimum requirement is that economic factors in the RTS are required to be customised to        each relevant jurisdiction and sector. A typical example of where the use of calibration        segments should be considered is the situation when an LGD model is rolled out to a different        jurisdiction. The drivers for LGD might be the same in a different jurisdiction and thus the LGD        model might provide a reasonable risk differentiation in a different jurisdiction, but the overall        loss profile might be significantly different due to, for example, different legal processes in the        context of collateral liquidation. It may, however, also turn out that loss characteristics and        levels are independent from, for example, jurisdictions or industry sectors, in which case the        differentiation of calibration segments might not be necessary.	0
Scope of application	6. These guidelines apply in relation to the IRB Approach in accordance with Part Three, Title II,    Chapter 3 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for all methods based on own estimates of LGD. The    use of own estimates of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn, in accordance with these    guidelines, is subject to supervisory approval in accordance with Article 144 of Regulation (EU)    No 575/2013. These guidelines do not apply to the calculation of own funds requirements for    dilution risk in accordance with Article 157 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.	0

For example, in    specific cases where a special purpose entity that is controlled by another client (e.g. an    originator) is fully ring-fenced and bankruptcy remote – so that there is no possible channel of    contagion, and hence no single risk, between the special purpose entity and the controlling entity    – it may be possible to demonstrate that no single risk exists (see scenario C 1 in the annex).	0

Where an institution’s policies/limits permit the taking of interest rate risk positions within the     banking book, these risks should be measured and monitored like any other market risk. Internal     capital should be specifically allocated to reflect these risks, the quantum of which may be     gauged by considering other capital requirements for market risk. Institutions should regularly     consider whether any positions held should be characterised as ‘trading’ and thereby treated     accordingly for capital adequacy purposes.	0

   242. In nearly half of the LGD models, the downturn adjustment is specified at the level of the       LGD model, whereas in smaller shares of models, the downturn adjustment is specified at a       lower level: at the level of the grade or pool (in 27% of models), differentiated according to       the type of collateral (9%) or differentiated by product type (2%) (see Figure 52). In around       4% of models, the downturn adjustment is specified uniformly in the institution. Some       respondents (around 6%) mentioned that the downturn adjustment is applied at model       component level, in which case it is not entirely clear whether this leads to a different       adjustment by grade or pool, collateral, or product type, or whether this leads to a uniform       adjustment for all exposures under the scope of application of the LGD model.

The EBA agrees with the rationale behind this proposal, but, taking into account that the term     ‘payment channel’ is not defined in PSD2 and that payment instruments are linked to the     provision of a specific payment service, the EBA has introduced payment services as another     criterion to be assessed in the aggregate analysis of complaints.	0

30.On the basis of the available information, institutions should be able to identify all control    relationships and economic dependencies among their clients, regardless of the size of their    exposures. The guidelines acknowledge, however, the inherent difficulty of identifying economic    dependencies among clients and state that institutions should strengthen their investigations in    all cases where the sum of all exposures to one individual client exceeds 5% of Tier 1 capital.	31.It is important to note that institutions should also collect information on all entities forming a    ‘chain of contagion’ to be able to correctly identify groups of connected clients. However, if there    are interconnections among entities with which the institution has no business relation (and thus    has not collected any information with regard to possible interconnections), the correct    identification of a group of connected clients might not be possible. Naturally, if an institution    becomes aware of such interconnections via entities outside its clientele (e.g. through press    statements), it needs to incorporate this information into its grouping practice.	0
      163. In accordance with paragraph 260 of Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)          No 680/2014, new forbearance measures granted to performing FBEs that have been          reclassified out of the non-performing category will entail the reclassification of these          transactions to the non-performing category. The same should apply when these exposures          become more than 30 days past due.	7.4 Consistent application of definition of non-performing	0

18 March 2015. The date of application for the guidelines will be one day after all translated versions are published. Member States may accelerate this application at their own discretion considering their deadline for sending the provisional lists. Recital 17 of the Directive specifies that Member States will have to appoint the competent authorities that will develop the provisional lists. The guidelines are addressed to those designated competent authorities.	From the provisional lists, the EBA is mandated to develop draft regulatory technical standards (RTS), by 18 September 2016 setting out the standardised Union terminology for those services that are common to at least a majority of Member States. The other two mandates for the EBA are to develop implementing technical standards (ITS), also by 18 September 2016, on a standardised presentation format for the fee information document and its common symbol and for the statement of fees and its common symbol. Both ITSs will require consumer testing. Before coming into effect, these technical standards have to be adopted by the Commission. Once the RTS have entered into force, there will be a further nine-month period, as set out in Article 29(2), at the end of which payment service providers (PSPs) will have to start providing information in line with the Directive.	0

      5. In 2014, in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 on supervisory reporting          the EBA introduced definitions of NPEs and forborne exposures (FBEs) to facilitate the          identification of problematic assets. Despite the decreasing trend in levels of NPEs in most          EU Member States, the pace of reduction of NPLs has been slow. This slow pace of reduction          is mainly due to the discretion allowed banks’ management and supervisors, together with          the absence of an effective secondary market for NPEs and challenging legal systems, which          have incentivised credit institutions to keep the loans on their balance sheets.	2   The EBA Risk Dashboard; data as of Q1 2018: http://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/risk-dashboard.	0

35. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (a) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should consider that an obligor is unlikely to pay     where interest related to credit obligations is no longer recognised in the income statement     of the institution due to the decrease of the credit quality of the obligation.

8.   In summary, these Guidelines are aimed at fulfilling the EBA’s overall objective, as set out in      Article 1(5) of the EBA Regulation, of ensuring the consistent, efficient and effective application      of the legislative acts that fall into the EBA’s scope of action.	9.   A draft Consultation Paper on the Guidelines was published in February 2017 for a three-month      consultation period, which closed on 16 May 2017. The EBA received 12 responses from various      market participants, such as PSPs, trade associations and consumer associations. These      respondents raised 59 distinct issues.	0

The guidelines also provide guidance on the assessment of situations where control and economic dependency are interlinked and can therefore lead to the existence of one group of connected clients as opposed to two separate groups of connected clients. The overarching indicator is the existence of a ‘single risk’ between two or more clients (‘domino effect’), regardless of the type of connection the single risk is based on. The chain of contagion leading to possible default of all entities concerned is therefore the relevant factor for the grouping.	The final section of the guidelines sets out the control and management procedures for identifying connected clients. It is in the interest of an institution to identify all possible connections among its clients to have a clear understanding of the risks it is exposed to. The guidelines expect institutions to identify all control relationships and also to take reasonable steps and use readily available information to investigate and identify economic dependencies among their clients. The guidelines also acknowledge the inherent difficulty of identifying all economic dependencies and require that institutions take a proportionate approach and strengthen the investigation of economic dependencies in all cases where the sum of all exposures to one individual client exceeds 5% of Tier 1 capital.	0

14.Given that the decisive factor for the assessment of the existence of a control relationship is the    accounting criteria or indicators of control set out in paragraph 13(a), (b) and (c), institutions    should group two or more clients on account of a relationship of control, as described in this    section, even where these clients are not included in the same consolidated financial statements    because exemptions apply to them under the relevant accounting rules, for example under    Article 23 of Directive 2013/34/EU.	15.Institutions should group two or more clients into a group of connected clients on account of a    relationship of control among these clients regardless of whether or not the exposures to these    clients are exempted from the application of the large exposures limit under Article 400(1) and (2)    of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or in accordance with exemptions under national rules    implementing Article 493(3) of that Regulation.	0

Payment service users and other interested parties are further concerned about lower consumer protection in EU Member States other than their home countries ( 3).	To address these issues, the Guidelines identify and describe requirements for the procedures for complaints of alleged infringements of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, to be put in place by competent authorities to enhance Member States’ current practices and the enforcement of consumers’ rights, and thereby strengthen consumer protection.	0

32. Several respondents suggested that the aggregate analysis of complaints under Guideline 4     should be made publicly available, either by the national CA or by the EBA.	33. By way of response, the EBA would like to highlight that the purpose of these Guidelines is to     establish a procedure for submission of complaints related to alleged infringements of PSD2.     The information under Guideline 4.1.f. is related to the overall assessment of complaints and the     subsequent supervisory measures taken by the CA. Taking into account the sensitivity of this     information, the EBA is of the view that the question of whether or not the aggregate analysis of     complaints under Guideline 4 should be made publicly available is a matter to be left to national     administrative laws and CAs’ internal policies and procedures.	0

Section 2.8 of the QIS report shows that there are greatly differing interpretations of distressed restructuring as an indication of unlikeliness to pay, as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of the CRR. In half of the institutions distressed restructuring triggers default only if it leads to a diminished financial obligation, and in another 20% of the institutions it triggers default with no other conditions applied. Only around 20% of those institutions use a quantitative threshold related to distressed restructuring, but these thresholds follow a different concept from that specified in the GL and use as a reference figure the exposure value rather than a measure of loss.	Regarding the sale of credit obligations the results of the qualitative part of the QIS are limited. Section 2.9 of the QIS report shows that the requirements set out in the GL will not affect the majority of the institutions participating in the QIS, which claim that normally they do not sell credit obligations. The remaining institutions sell credit obligations, but only occasionally, and only 20% of them use a quantitative threshold for evaluating the materiality of the credit-related economic loss associated with the sale.	0

The objective of the GL is to establish convergence of institutions’ practices and supervisory practices regarding the application of the definition of default. The GL are complementary to the RTS on the materiality threshold for credit obligations past due under Article 178(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (RTS on the materiality threshold) and specify indications and criteria for the application of the definition of default. Harmonisation of the current practices, which vary across Member States and institutions, is expected to enhance comparability of own funds and own funds requirements and to reduce the burden for cross-border institutions of complying with different regulatory frameworks.

As certain choices in the application of the default definition may have a significant impact on own funds requirements it is important to ensure a level playing field across institutions in the entire EU. Therefore, these guidelines provide detailed guidance on the application of various aspects of the definition of default, including the past due criterion as an indication of default, indications of unlikeliness to pay, specific aspects of the application of the definition of default for retail exposures, application of the default definition in a banking group, treatment of external data and criteria for a return to non-defaulted status. It is expected that the harmonisation of practices will not only increase comparability of risk parameters and own funds requirements but also reduce the burden for cross-border institutions of complying with different requirements in different Member States.	2.1 Implementation of the changes in the definition of default It has been recognised that the implementation of these guidelines might in some cases require significant time and efforts, especially in the case of institutions that use the IRB Approach and where	0

Section 2.4 of the QIS report shows that more than half of the institutions either do not have a definition of technical past due situations in place or recognise technical default on a case-by-case basis. The majority of institutions which have a definition for technical defaults in place use a definition that is in line with the one proposed in the GL.	0

When delay in payment occurs on an individual credit obligation, the materiality of such    delay should be assessed by applying the materiality threshold referred to in point (d) of    Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to all individual credit obligations of this    obligor, without taking into account any joint credit obligations of that obligor with other    individuals or entities. Where the materiality threshold calculated in this way is breached, all    individual exposures to this obligor should be considered defaulted.	10.

2.1 Introduction	1. The quantification of downturn LGD has been challenging for competent authorities, industry            and academics alike ever since the Basel II framework introduced this concept. The            requirement for loss given default (LGD) and conversion factor (CF) estimates to reflect            economic downturn conditions was introduced in the Basel II capital framework and stems            from the general economic model that is used to derive the formula for calculating minimum            own funds requirements. In the Basel II capital framework, unexpected losses are based on the            conditional expected loss given a high confidence level for the single systematic risk factor            leading to high credit losses. Whereas the risk weight formula includes a supervisory mapping            function to derive conditional probabilities of default (PDs) 6 from unconditional long-run            average PDs estimated by the institutions, it does not provide an explicit function that would            transform long-run average LGDs and exposures at default (EADs) into conditional LGDs and            exposure values (respectively CFs). Instead, it requires institutions to use LGDs that are            appropriate for an economic downturn. The lack of explicit guidance and limited supervisory            and industry consensus on how to incorporate the economic downturn component in model            estimation has led to significant differences in practices and has given rise to unwarranted            variability in risk-weighted exposure (RWE) amounts when own estimates of LGDs and/or CFs            are used.	0

It includes a risk appetite                                          statement, risk limits and an outline of the roles and  Risk appetite framework (RAF)                                          responsibilities of those overseeing the implementation and                                          monitoring of the RAF. The RAF should consider material risks to                                          the credit institution, as well as to its reputation with depositors,                                          investors and customers. The RAF aligns with the bank’s strategy	                                         Texas ratio: a ratio comparing the stock of NPLs with a credit  Texas ratio                             institution’s equity.

      2. The dispersion of the stock of NPEs is uneven across Member States. There are currently 12          Member States experiencing above average NPE ratios, and the scale and the cross-border          implications make this an EU-wide problem. The overall level remains high by historic          standards, even though the joint efforts of banks, supervisors and macroprudential          authorities have led to a slow improvement in NPE ratios over recent years.	      3. The EBA’s risk analysis, supported by similar research conducted by other international          organisations, indicated that high levels of NPEs are a drag on profitability and are strongly          correlated with weak lending growth. The effects of high levels of NPEs on banks’ balance          sheets on, inter alia, funding costs and capital and profitability can seriously jeopardise          institutions’ ability to run a viable and sustainable business model.	0
2.3.   The competent authority should report the values in euro currency. It should convert data        for values of transactions or fraudulent transactions denominated in a currency other than        the euro, using the relevant exchange rates applied to these transactions or the average ECB        reference exchange rate for the applicable reporting period.	2.4.

             •   Context of disclosure: this factor requires the avoidance of disclosure of confidential                  information when a set of circumstances such as the means of the disclosure, the                  number and the characteristics of the addressees, the timing of the disclosure and                  any other distinctive circumstance creates a risk that the individual institutions or                  entities will be identifiable.	    9. The approach taken in the draft guidelines fulfils the mandate and at the same time provides        flexibility, considering that there may be different types of confidential information as well as        different circumstances and situations in which confidential information may need to be        disclosed, which may increase or decrease the risk that individual institutions or entities will        be identifiable from the information provided in summary or collective form. The principles        defined in the draft guidelines will guide authorities as to which aspects have to be        considered in order to eliminate that risk.	0

In accordance with paragraph 5.5.10 of IFRS 9, ´an entity may assume that the credit risk    on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial    instrument is determined to have a low credit risk at the reporting date´. Although credit    institutions thus have the option for ‘low credit risk’ exposures not to assess whether credit    risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, use of this exemption should be    limited. In particular, credit institutions should conduct timely assessment of significant    increases in credit risk for all lending exposures.	0

As set out in Recital 15 of the Directive, it is vital for consumers to be able to understand fees so that they are able to compare offers from different PSPs and make informed decisions as to which payment account is most suitable for their needs. Comparison between fees is made more difficult if PSPs use different terminology for the same services and provide information in different formats. Standardised terminology, coupled with targeted fee information presented in a consistent format covering the most representative services linked to payment accounts, may help consumers to understand and compare fees.	                                                                                                        5 REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON NATIONAL PROVISIONAL LISTS OF THE MOST REPRESENTATIVE SERVICES	0
Default definition is the basis for all risk parameters estimated according to IRB models and for the calculation of own funds requirements. Therefore, by establishing harmonised criteria for the application of the definition of default greater comparability of risk estimates and own funds requirements for credit risk will be ensured. This will contribute to increased confidence of external stakeholders such as investors in the adequacy of the levels of capital held by institutions and in the longer term will help achieve greater stability of the institutions. Furthermore, aligning supervisory expectations in the area of default definition will contribute towards ensuring a level playing field for the institutions. Finally, similar practices applied in all jurisdictions will reduce the administrative and operational burdens for cross-border institutions of complying with different regulatory frameworks in different Member States.	                                                                                                        68 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	0
As part of the design of remuneration policies and practices, the BSG believes that institutions should consider mechanisms for risk management and controls to monitor any risks which might arise from their policies and practices relating to consumer protection.	The EBA concurred with the view of the BSG but believes that the concerns raised are already addressed by guideline 3 on ‘Approval and monitoring’, and in particular Guidelines 3.5, 3.6 and	0

These guidelines should be implemented at the start of the first accounting period beginning     on or after 1 January 2018.	                                                                                             16 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS’ CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES	0
         (d) speculative immovable property financing.	Article 128(3) CRR provides a mandate to the European Banking Authority (EBA) to draft guidelines that specify which types of exposures, other than those mentioned in Article 128(2) CRR, are to be associated with particularly high risk and the circumstances under which this should happen. As a result of an exposure being identified as an ‘item of particularly high risk’, such exposure receives a risk weight of 150%.	0
Title IV – Liquidity indicators	26.Liquidity indicators should be able to inform an institution of the potential for, or an actual    deterioration of the capacity of the institution to meet its current and foreseen liquidity and    funding needs.	0
34.The overall IRRBB strategy should also include the decision about the extent to which the    business model relies on generating earnings by ‘riding the yield curve’, i.e. funding assets with    a comparatively long repricing period with liabilities with a comparatively short repricing period.    Where the business model relies heavily on this source of earnings, the management body	                                                                                                   11 GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES	0
   4.2.7          Principle 7 — Common processes, systems, tools and data	   Credit institutions should have a sound credit risk assessment and measurement process that    provides them with a strong basis for common processes, systems, tools and data to assess    credit risk and to account for expected credit losses.	0
Any changes in the definition of default will affect in particular those institutions that use the IRB approach. The risk parameters are estimated on the basis of historical data collected using certain default identification processes. The consistency of the historical data with the adequate default definition is crucial for the correct calibration of risk parameters. The historical data will therefore have to be adjusted to the requirements of the GL and the parameters will have to be recalibrated to reflect the current default definition.	The adjustment of data and recalibration of risk parameters may impose a significant operational burden on the institutions that use the IRB Approach. In particular, for those institutions that use numerous rating systems and where the definition of default will change significantly, the process of implementing necessary adjustments might be costly and time consuming.	0

Listing the services	Competent authorities should first assess the services that could potentially be included in their provisional list by ranking them against each of the criteria specified in Article 3(2). The EBA considers that the criteria in Article 3(2) do not need to be applied cumulatively. Competent authorities may apply these criteria independently. Competent authorities should rank the services that satisfy both of the criteria, and the ones that satisfy one of them. Competent authorities should follow the process to determine the relative merits of a service’s inclusion on the list set out in Title II.	0

(b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU should be avoided.	11.3.   Context of disclosure: disclosure of confidential information should be avoided when a         set of circumstances such as the means of the disclosure, the number and the         characteristics of the addressees, the timing of the disclosure and any other distinctive         circumstance creates a risk of the individual institutions or entities referred to in point (b),	0
       4. Thus the EBA mandate relates only to the second exemption, namely the possibility of           disclosing confidential information in summary or collective form such that individual           institutions or entities cannot be identified.	       5. It is important to mention that disclosure of confidential information under this exemption           covers a limited number of cases, namely when the defined persons (Article 84(1) of the           BRRD) disclose confidential information, when not in the exercise of their functions under           the BRRD (the first exemption) and without the express and prior consent of the institution           (the third exemption).	0
18.The calibration of the additional factor Ψ , due to behavioural factors referred to in paragraph    17, should be made where a relevant amount of these instruments with prepayment risk are    held in the trading book and especially where the counterparties are retail clients. Additional    factors should not be considered for the embedded options where the institution has the right    to call for an early termination of the instrument.	                                                                                                20 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CORRECTIONS TO MODIFIED DURATION	0
103.   Thus, in order to meet the objective of IFRS 9 in a robust manner, credit institutions    should also consider the linkages between macroeconomic factors and borrower attributes to    the level of credit risk in a portfolio based on reasonable and supportable information. To that    end, credit institutions should start with a detailed analysis of historical patterns and current    trends, which would allow for identification of the most relevant credit risk drivers.    Experienced credit judgement should facilitate the incorporation of current and forecasted    conditions likely to affect those risk drivers, the expected cash shortfalls and therefore loss    expectations.	104.   Credit institutions should perform analyses of this kind not only in the context of    portfolios of individually small credits, such as credit card exposures, but also for large,    individually managed lending exposures. For example, for a large commercial property loan,    credit institutions should take account of the considerable sensitivity of the commercial    property market in many jurisdictions to the general macroeconomic environment, and    consider using information such as levels of interest rates or vacancy rates to determine    whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.	0

49. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a distressed restructuring should be considered to have     occurred when concessions have been extended towards a debtor facing or about to face     difficulties in meeting its financial commitments as specified in paragraphs 163-167 and 172-	174 of Annex V Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 of 16 April 2014 3 as     amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/227 4.	0
      If one assumes that the current state of the economic cycle is different from the one observed       during the economic downturn, i.e. that the economy is currently in an upturn, then the downturn       LGD estimations applied to the current portfolio result in the following picture, where the column       ‘DT LGD’ represents the downturn LGD estimates per grade and the column ‘% # FACILITIES’       illustrates the current percentage of facilities that are observed in each LTV band.	    27.In summary, Example 3 illustrates that, in cases of LGD models based on risk drivers sensitive        to the economic cycle, the impact on the current capital requirements of an upcoming        economic upturn (or downturn) is twofold: (i) the impact stemming from the expected lower        (or higher) realised economic losses per facility (in the event of a downturn, this is covered by        the downturn LGD estimation by grade) and (ii) the impact stemming from the migrations of        facilities to lower (or higher) LTV bands.	0
These guidelines should be reviewed by 31 July 2017.	                                                                                                     8 GL ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SALE OF BUSINESS TOOL	0
         (o) The assumed behavioural repricing date for retail and non-financial wholesale deposits              without any specific repricing dates (non-maturity deposits) should be constrained to              a maximum average of 5 years. The 5-year cap applies individually for each currency.              Non-maturity deposits from financial institutions should not be subject to behavioural              modelling.	116. When computing the effects of the standard EVE outlier test, institutions should use the    calculation methods set out under the economic value of equity headings in Annex I and    Annex II.	0
8. These guidelines are addressed to competent authorities as defined in point (i) of Article 4(2) of    Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and to financial institutions as defined in Article 4(1) of Regulation    (EU) No 1093/2010.	Definitions	0
69. Aggregated information should provide sufficient detail to enable the management to assess the     sensitivity of the institution to changes in market conditions and other important risk factors.     These reports should contain information on exposures to repricing, basis, yield curve and     optionality risk as well as information on the types and results of stress tests performed,     including the standard shocks prescribed by the competent authority.	                                                                                                     17 GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING ACTIVITIES	0
12. More specifically, one national authority reported that by end July 2015 (since January 2011),     banks in that Member State had paid out approximately EUR 27.8 billion in refunds and     compensation as a result of mis-selling of payment protection insurance. According to the     same source, in the first half of 2015 almost 740 000 new complaints were opened in relation     to banking and credit card products. Almost 280 000 of those complaints were related to the     advising, selling and arranging of those products31.	13. Taking into account the large amounts of direct and indirect costs related to mis-selling for     consumers as well as providers of retail banking products observed in recent years, and the     causal link with sales incentives and remuneration policies and practices, the development     and issuance of Guidelines on the EBA’s own initiative is expected to create net benefits for     consumers and the market for retail banking services in the EU and is thus the preferred     option (Option 1.2).	0
b. deterioration of prospects for the sector or industries within which a borrower operates.	109.    Accurate identification of drivers of credit risk, and reliable demonstration of the linkages    between those drivers and the level of credit risk, should be considered as critical, as a    seemingly small change in a qualitative characteristic of a loan can potentially be a leading    indicator of a large increase in the risk of a default occurring. Furthermore, in accordance with    IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.9, the significance of a change in credit risk since initial recognition    depends on the risk of a default occurring at initial recognition. In this regard, where a credit    institution uses changes in PD as a means of identifying changes in the risk of a default    occurring, it should take into consideration the significance of a given change in PD expressed    in a ratio (or the rate of fluctuation) proportionate to the PD at initial recognition (i.e. a    change in the PD divided by the PD at initial recognition), considering also paragraph B5.5.11	0
   Credit institutions should have a sound credit risk assessment and measurement process that    provides them with a strong basis for common processes, systems, tools and data to assess    credit risk and to account for expected credit losses.	75. To the maximum extent possible, credit institutions should use common processes, systems,     tools and data to assess credit risk, measure ECL for accounting purposes and determine     expected losses for capital adequacy purposes in order to strengthen the reliability and     consistency of the resulting ECL estimates, increase transparency and, through market     discipline, provide incentives to follow sound credit risk practices.	0

It is proposed that the threshold set by the institutions should not be higher than 1%. The proposed cap in this situation is lower because it is meant to capture cases where the change in the NPV of the contract results from technical discounting aspects and rounding of the amounts. Where, however, the diminished NPV results from a conscious decision of an institution due to the client’s financial difficulties the situation should be treated as a defaults.

11. Competent authorities should ensure that credit institutions comply with these guidelines on     an individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated basis in accordance with Article 109 of     Directive 2013/36/EU.	12. Guidelines set out in section 4.4 should be considered as supplementing and further     specifying the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) referred to in Article 97 and     107(1)(a) of Directive 2013/36/EU, in particular with regard to the assessment of credit risk     management and controls and accounting for expected credit losses.

In 19% of models, those exposures for which the recoveries occurred in the downturn       period are selected (e.g. assigning exposures to a downturn period if the majority of the       realised recoveries are observed during the downturn period). In two institutions, the data       are selected according to defaulted exposures for which the recovery process starts during       the downturn period. However, in around 15% of models defaulted exposures are selected       for which the recovery process closes during the downturn period.	                                                                                                                 59 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN	0

61. When specifying the criteria for unlikeliness to pay, institutions should take into consideration     the relations within the groups of connected clients as defined in point 39 of Article 4(1) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In particular institutions should specify in their internal policies     when the default of one obligor within the group of connected clients has a contagious effect     on other entities within this group. Such specifications should be in line with the appropriate     policies for the assignment of exposures to individual obligor to an obligor grade and to     groups of connected clients in accordance with point (d) of Article 172(1) of Regulation (EU)     No 575/2013. Where such criteria have not been specified for a non-standard situation, in the     case of default of an obligor that is part of a group of connected clients, institutions should     assess the potential unlikeliness to pay of all other entities within this group on a case-by-case     basis.	62. Where a financial asset was purchased or originated by an institution at a material discount     institutions should assess whether that discount reflects the deteriorated credit quality of the     obligor and whether there are any indications of default in accordance with these guidelines.     The assessment of unlikeliness to pay should refer to the total amount owed by the obligor     regardless of the price that the institution has paid for the asset.

Cost-benefit analysis/impact assessment This impact assessment provides an analysis of the potential related costs and benefits of the policy provided in the present guidelines. This analysis provides the reader with an overview of the findings as regards the identification of the problem, the options identified to deal with the problem and the potential impacts of these options.	The following analysis consists of three parts. The first part provides an analysis of the baseline scenario in terms of institutions’ current practices, supervisory rules and practices, and the regulatory environment. The second part contains the options considered with respect to the major policy decisions included in the Consultation Paper. Finally, the cost-benefit analysis is based on the main policy changes in comparison with the current supervisory rules and practices, institutions’ current practices and the regulatory environment.	0
78.Institutions may rely on third-party IRRBB models to manage and control IRRBB, provided that    these models are adequately customised to properly reflect the specific characteristics of the    institution in question. Institutions are expected to fully understand the underlying analytics,    assumptions and methodologies of the third-party models and to ensure that they are    adequately integrated into the institutions’ overall risk management systems and processes.    Where third parties provide input for market data, behavioural assumptions or model settings,    the institution should have a process in place to determine if those inputs are reasonable for its    business and the risk characteristics of its activities. Institutions should ensure there is adequate    documentation of their use of third-party models, including any specific customisation.	                                                                                                     22 GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES	0

Reporting requirements	3. According to Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, competent authorities must    notify the EBA of whether they comply or intend to comply with these guidelines, or    otherwise must provide reasons for non-compliance, by 08/08/2016. In the absence of any    notification by this deadline, competent authorities will be considered by the EBA to be noncompliant . Notifications should be sent by submitting the form available on the EBA website    to compliance@eba.europa.eu with the reference ‘EBA/GL/2016/02’. Notifications should be    submitted by persons with appropriate authority to report compliance on behalf of their    competent authorities. Any change in the status of compliance must also be reported to the    EBA.	0
26.The concepts of control and economic dependency are two different kinds of interconnection to    be assessed separately. However, there are situations where the two types of dependencies are    interlinked and could therefore exist within one group of connected clients in such a way that all    relevant clients constitute a single risk. The wording in point (b) of Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation    (EU) No 575/2013, ‘between whom there is no relationship of control’, does not lead to two    mutually exclusive grouping requirements. It should rather be understood as meaning that the    control relationship is a grouping requirement due to a very strong form of dependency (control    as legal dependency) and thus is a subcategory of the wider form of economic dependency. The    overarching indicator is the same in both cases, i.e. a single risk between two or more clients    (‘domino effect’), regardless of the type of connection the single risk is based on. The chain of    contagion leading to possible default of all entities concerned is the relevant factor for the    grouping and needs to be assessed in each individual case.	27.Downstream contagion should be assumed when an entity is economically dependent on another    client and is itself the head of a ‘control group’, i.e. a group of connected clients formed on    account of the existence of a control relationship in accordance with Article 4(1)(39)(a) of    Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. If the other client is part of a group of connected clients, the    control group of the economically dependent entity should then be included in the group of    connected clients to which the economic dependency relationship exists. The reason for this is    that, to overcome its own pending payment difficulties, the economically dependent entity will	0
2. These guidelines focus exclusively on the issue of connected clients under Article 4(1)(39) of    Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and apply to all areas of that Regulation where the concept of    connected clients is used, i.e. the large exposures regime (Part Four of that Regulation), the    categorisation of clients in the retail exposure class for the purposes of credit risk (Article 123(c)    and Article 147(5)(a)(ii)), the development and application of rating systems (Article 172(1)(d))    and the SME supporting factor (Article 501(2)(c)). The guidelines also apply to EBA technical    standards and EBA guidelines that refer to ‘groups of connected clients’ as defined in    Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, namely in the area of liquidity reporting, where    this concept is used in the specification of items requiring stable funding that must be reported to    the competent authorities (Article 428(1)(g)(ii) of that Regulation), and in the reporting of    concentration of funding by counterparty and concentration of counterbalancing capacity by    issuer/counterpart. 4 Additionally, the guidelines take into account developments in the areas of    shadow banking and large exposures at EU and international levels. 5	3. The objective of the definition of ‘connected clients’ in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is to identify    clients so closely linked by idiosyncratic risk factors that it is prudent to treat them as a single risk.    Idiosyncratic risk represents the effect of risks that are specific to individual clients. Idiosyncratic    risk arises where, in a bilateral interrelationship, financial problems of one entity are transferred    via this interrelationship to another entity that otherwise would not be concerned. Consequently,    the purpose of these guidelines is to clarify and operationalise the concept of interconnection, in    particular when control issues or economic dependency should lead to the grouping of clients    because they constitute a single risk in accordance with Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU)    No 575/2013.	0

1.    Competent authorities should consider whether the originator institution has appropriate       internal policies for making its own assessment of credit risk transfer and SRT. This should       include not only an initial assessment of the transaction when the originator institution is       first seeking the exclusion of securitised exposures from the calculation of risk-weighted       exposure amounts and, as relevant, expected loss amounts, but should also consider the       ongoing assessment of SRT during the life of the transaction.

2.4      The risks taken into account by the viability analysis in the business reorganisation plan          should be consistent with institution-specific and broader risks identified by the          competent authority, the central bank or other relevant authority or institution in the          relevant markets.	2.5      The worst-case scenario should reflect a significant, albeit plausible, change in the          underlying assumptions in comparison to the base-case scenario. These changes should          focus in particular on the assumptions that are more relevant for the institution under          reorganisation.	0
44. Institutions should set a threshold for the credit-related economic loss related with the sale of     credit obligations to be considered material, which should be calculated according to the     following formula, and should not be higher than 5%:	          𝐸𝐸 − 𝑃𝑃    𝐿𝐿 =              𝐸𝐸	0

In accordance with paragraph 260 of Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)          No 680/2014, new forbearance measures granted to performing FBEs that have been          reclassified out of the non-performing category will entail the reclassification of these          transactions to the non-performing category. The same should apply when these exposures          become more than 30 days past due.	0
      The above example could relate in more detail relate to Example 1 where the institution would       have identified two downturn periods to be analysed for the considered type of exposure:	      In this example the institution has no observed loss data related to this downturn period in       1990-1991. As the house price index is a transformed input into the institution’s model for       LGD estimation, and is also a relevant economic factor related to a type of collateral for the       considered type of exposure, the institution would need to apply a haircut approach according       to the policy in paragraph 30 of the GLs.	0

51. The overall IRRBB strategy should also include the decision about the extent to which the     business model should rely on generating earnings by ‘riding the yield curve’, i.e. funding assets     with a comparatively long repricing period from liabilities with a comparatively short repricing     period. Where the business model relies heavily on this source of earnings, the management     body should explain its IRRBB strategy and how it plans to survive periods of flat or inverse yield     curves.	52. Institutions should treat IRRBB as a material risk and assess it explicitly and comprehensively in     their risk management processes. Any other approach should be fully documented and justified     in the course of supervisory dialogue.	0

        (d) an institution has information that a third party, in particular another institution, has             filed for bankruptcy or similar protection of the obligor.	61. When specifying the criteria for unlikeliness to pay, institutions should take into consideration     the relations within the groups of connected clients as defined in point 39 of Article 4(1) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In particular institutions should specify in their internal policies     when the default of one obligor within the group of connected clients has a contagious effect     on other entities within this group. Such specifications should be in line with the appropriate     policies for the assignment of exposures to individual obligor to an obligor grade and to     groups of connected clients in accordance with point (d) of Article 172(1) of Regulation (EU)     No 575/2013. Where such criteria have not been specified for a non-standard situation, in the     case of default of an obligor that is part of a group of connected clients, institutions should     assess the potential unlikeliness to pay of all other entities within this group on a case-by-case     basis.	0
Furthermore, an objective should be to ensure that national authorities are collecting the data they need to assess effectively the impact of credit institutions’ funding plans on the flow of credit to the real economy, both at a national and EU-wide level (as per ESRB Recommendation A3).	For the monitoring and assessment of funding plans to be comparable and to work effectively for cross-border institutions, it is necessary to use consistent definitions and information structured in a way that allows different levels of aggregation. This will enable authorities to identify inconsistencies that will only become evident in a systemic context (e.g. a situation where all banks expect to grow deposits at a pace that the total deposit base could not deliver).	0
19. In addition, and in line with suggestions from a number of respondents, the two categories     mentioned above have been aligned with fraud types and sub-types detailed in Annex 2.	20. Regarding the reporting of fraudulent payment transactions in the context of direct debits, the     EBA clarifies that refunds under eight weeks should not be automatically reported, as they do not     always indicate fraud cases; such transactions should be reported only if they were subject to fraud     and the reporting PSP was aware that this was the case, without implying any legal obligation to     ask the payment service user whether this was the case.	0

Option 2a is expected to be more expensive for both the resolution authorities (higher administrative cost) and the public/tax payers (higher opportunity cost and higher risk). Costs associated with the implementation of Option 2b are not expected to go beyond the work that the resolution authorities need to carry out under the Level 1 text.	In terms of benefits, a more precise and harmonised regulatory framework is expected to tackle the identified problems. Resolution authorities are expected to benefit from symmetric information and more effective and efficient cooperation across jurisdictions. This then decreases the probability of the systemic risk and bank failure-related risk to the public.	0

Background and rationale Article 128(3) CRR gives a mandate to the EBA for drafting guidelines that specify which types of exposures, other than those mentioned in Article 128(2) CRR, are associated with particularly high risk and the circumstances under which this should happen, which would result in these exposures receiving a risk weight of 150%. The mandate represents the implementation of the discretion that national supervisors are granted in paragraph 80 of the Basel II agreement, which states that national supervisors may decide to apply a 150% (or higher) risk weight that reflects ‘the higher risks associated with some other assets, such as venture capital and private equity investments’.	It should be noted that the Basel II agreement considers all credit exposures carrying a risk weight of 150% or higher to be high risk assets. However, in Article 128, the CRR sets out the notion of ‘items associated with particular high risk’, which serves as a possibility to assign a 150% risk weight where this is not provided by the respective original asset class of a considered exposure. As a result, an exposure that falls under Article 128 CRR is excluded from its original exposure class and is considered instead under ‘items associated with particular high risk’ of Article 128. A high risk exposure (according to the notion provided by the Basel standard) that already receives a 150% risk weight in its original exposure class (e.g. Credit Quality Step 5 or 6 for exposures to corporates) is therefore not affected by Article 128 CRR. The CRR specifies in Article 128(2) four types of exposures that shall be considered as items associated with particularly high risk, namely:	0

131.    IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.15, states that ´an entity shall consider reasonable and    supportable information that is available without undue cost and effort´ and that ‘an entity    need not undertake an exhaustive search for information when determining whether credit    risk has increased significantly since initial recognition’. Credit institutions should not read    these statements restrictively and should develop systems and processes that use all    reasonable and supportable information that is relevant to the group of exposures or    individual exposure, as needed to achieve a high-quality, robust and consistent    implementation of the accounting requirements. Nevertheless, additional cost and    operational burden do not need to be introduced where they do not contribute to a highquality implementation of IFRS 9.	‘Low credit risk’ exemption	0

More than a third of the institutions do not consider specific credit risk adjustments (SCRA) resulting from a perceived decline in the credit quality of an obligation as an indication of unlikeness to pay, as Section 2.7 of the QIS report shows. Moreover, around 20% of the institutions reported using the impairment of an exposure as a potential trigger for default, and they are split between those that consider this regardless of whether there are any SCRA assigned, in line with the GL, and those which instead consider impairment only if SCRA are assigned.	Section 2.8 of the QIS report shows that there are greatly differing interpretations of distressed restructuring as an indication of unlikeliness to pay, as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of the CRR. In half of the institutions distressed restructuring triggers default only if it leads to a diminished financial obligation, and in another 20% of the institutions it triggers default with no other conditions applied. Only around 20% of those institutions use a quantitative threshold related to distressed restructuring, but these thresholds follow a different concept from that specified in the GL and use as a reference figure the exposure value rather than a measure of loss.	0
   244. When it comes to the methodologies that institutions use to determine downturn LGD       estimates, a wide variety of practices can be observed (see Figure 53). However, in 38% of       LGD models, the downturn period value is used for all model components (22%), or for the       most relevant components (16%). In 23% of LGD models, a fixed downturn adjustment is       applied, and in 9% of models the LGD estimation is based on data from the downturn period       without using model components.	   245. Around 17% of respondents indicate that they use conservatism in the model       development process to reflect downturn LGD estimates.	0
If there is a dispute between the obligor and the institution over the credit obligation it is not certain whether the obligation actually exists and hence the counting of days past due may be suspended until the dispute is resolved. However, in order to avoid excessive use of this rule, the possibility of suspending the counting is limited to those disputes that have been introduced to a court or another formal procedure such as arbitration that will result in a legally binding ruling. It was necessary to define specific rules for leasing operations as in this case the dispute is normally between the obligor and the provider of the leasing object rather than the institution itself. In this case a well justified formal complaint is a condition for the suspension of days past due. Factoring has not been included in this provision as, if it leads to the purchase of receivables, disputes between the debtor and the seller over the product are addressed under dilution risk.	   2.2.2           Technical past due situation	0

65. The institution should have appropriate procedures to handle any discrepancies and     irregularities that arise at the time of data processing. The institution should determine the     reasons for these and should have procedures in place for the mutual reconciliation of the     positions to enable these discrepancies and irregularities to be eliminated.	66. The institution should set up an appropriate process to ensure that the data used to feed models     measuring the IRRBB across the group, e.g. for simulating earnings, is consistent with the data     used for corporate planning.	0
     b) Each group of connected clients under point (a) includes also persons controlled by or         interconnected with the person who is directly controlled by or directly interconnected with         the central government (see scenario CG 3 in the annex).	19.Where the entities directly controlled by or directly interconnected with the central government    are economically dependent on each other, they should form separate groups of connected    clients (excluding the central government), in addition to the groups of connected clients formed    in accordance with the alternative approach (see scenario CG 4 in the annex).	0
    37.The rationale for the exemption is that the LGD in default converges by construction to 100%        and therefore the additional amount that can be lost due to an economic downturn decreases        over time.	    38.Moreover, it should be noted that the policy for downturn LGD estimation for defaulted        exposures relies on paragraph 193 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation, where it is clarified        that the final LGD for defaulted exposure appropriate for economic downturn conditions        should also include an appropriate MoC and where necessary potential additional unexpected        losses during the recovery period referred to in Article 181(1)(h) of Regulation (EU)        No 575/2013.	0

Institutions should establish policies regarding the definition of default in order to ensure its     consistent and effective application and in particular they should have clear policies and     procedures on the application of the criteria for unlikeliness to pay as laid down in Article     178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and all other indications of unlikeliness to pay as     specified by the institution, covering all types of exposures as defined in point (2) of Article     142(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, for all business lines, legal entities and geographical     locations.	65. With regard to each indication of unlikeliness to pay institutions should define the adequate     methods of their identification, including the sources of information and frequency of     monitoring. The sources of information should include both internal and external sources,     including in particular relevant external databases and registers.	0
   160. The existence of contract terms that extend the repayment period, such as grace periods       for the principal, should confirm the classification of these FBEs as non-performing until the       requirements of Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 have       been satisfied. The fact that the one-year cure period has elapsed should not automatically       lead to reclassification to performing unless regular payments have been made over these	12 months and an assessment of unlikeliness to pay has been concluded with no indication       of unlikeliness to pay.	0

of application of the materiality threshold a joint obligor, i.e. a specific set of individual obligors that commit to a joint exposure, should be treated as a different, separate obligor. This approach will ensure that the assessment of a joint exposure will not be diluted by the existence of other individual exposures.	2.8 Documentation, internal policies and risk management processes	0
The BSG considers the definition of default a very sensitive issue, where inappropriate treatment could disconnect the prudential status of the default from the economic reality of the counterparty. This would conflict with the requirement for a ‘use test’ incorporated in the IRB framework. Therefore, a sufficient degree of flexibility in the application of the rules is advocated, as is allowing the application of expert judgement where necessary.	The BSG points out that many of the suggested changes will require significant system changes as well as changes in the calibration and will in many cases require redevelopment of internal models. It is therefore requested that significant time is allowed for the adoption of the new regulations in order for institutions to be able to handle all necessary changes and to obtain supervisory approval for the changes made. It is also considered essential to implement the new definition of default at the same time as the review of all internal rating methodologies. One of the particular challenges for implementation mentioned by the BSG is the counting of days past due. It is suggested that in some situations identification of default at month-end only should be allowed.	0
7. The main body of the guidelines is structured in six sections, with section 4 introducing the          requirements for the NPE strategy, and section 5 providing details on the operationalisation          of the strategy and outlines supporting governance and operational arrangements. Section 6          sets out supervisory expectations regarding the use of forbearance, section 7 addresses the          recognition of NPEs, section 8 deals with NPE impairments and write-offs, and section 9          specifies supervisory requirements regarding the collateral valuation of movable and          immovable property. Furthermore, section 10 provides guidance to the competent          authorities on addressing NPEs and FBEs in the supervisory review and evaluation process          (SREP).	      8. The NPE strategy is the core building block of the guidelines for the banks’ NPE management.          The strategy sets the basis for the credit institutions’ initial and regular assessments of the          operating environment and describes the considerations that they should take into account.          These include the internal capabilities of the credit institution, external conditions and capital          implications. When developing their NPE strategy, credit institutions should also consider all          available strategic options and combinations of them. These include hold/forbearance          strategies, active portfolio reductions, taking collateral onto the balance sheet and legal          options including out-of-court options. Furthermore, implementing the operational plan and          embedding the NPE strategy into the institution are both important aspects of the NPE          strategy. The guidelines call for regular review of the strategy, monitoring of its operational          effectiveness and integration of it into the credit institution’s risk management framework.	0

The costs and benefits analysis includes the incremental costs and benefits besides those related to the application of IFRS 9, which will be generated from the application of these guidelines. It should also be considered that under national GAAP some Member States may also move towards the application of an ECL model, and these guidelines are also applicable in that case.	D1.

29. One respondent suggested that, when CAs respond to complainants and inform complainants     that the CA has forwarded the complaint to another authority or body, the CA should also     provide the contact details of the authority or body to which it has forwarded the complaint.	30. The EBA agrees that this suggestion would bring more transparency to the complaints     procedures, by informing complainants about the authority or body to which their complaint has     been forwarded and from which they might expect further communication. The EBA also     considers that complainants might benefit from having the contact details of that CA or body, in     case they would like to provide additional information for their complaint.	0
2. Guidelines set the EBA view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European System    of Financial Supervision or of how Union law should be applied in a particular area.    Competent authorities as defined in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 to whom    guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them into their practices as appropriate (e.g.    by amending their legal framework or their supervisory processes), including where guidelines    are directed primarily at institutions.

19. However, to address the issues raised, and to bring greater clarity, the EBA deleted the first part     of Guideline 2.1., which indicated that the information specified in the Guideline is requested     when the complaint is being submitted. The EBA then separated the existing Guideline 2.1. into     two new Guidelines: the new Guideline 2.1. concerning the request for information by CAs, and     Guideline 2.2. concerning the recording of that information.

   24.The objective of the guidelines is to increase the convergence of NPE and FBE management       practices across EU Member States, by clarifying how credit institutions should effectively       manage and ultimately reduce their non-performing and forborne exposures through the       establishment and operationalisation of an NPL strategy that is embedded in the credit       institution’s overall strategy.	   25.The guidelines, together with the guidelines on loan origination that the EBA has also been       invited to issue by the Council’s Action Plan, aim to address the existing stock of NPLs and to       prevent the accumulation of NPLs in the future.	0

Investments in venture capital firms or private equity	The part of the guidelines that deals with investments in venture capital firms or private equity contains clarification regarding the types of exposures that should be considered as investments in private equity and venture capital firms. It was considered necessary for the EBA to provide, on its own initiative and in line with its prerogatives, a definition for these two concepts for the purposes of the present guidelines. This is because definitions are necessary to ensure harmonisation regarding the types of exposures that are considered as investments in both venture capital and private equity.	0

Thus, these entities are not eligible for a separate    assessment of the existence of a group of connected clients. 9	0
19.Where the entities directly controlled by or directly interconnected with the central government    are economically dependent on each other, they should form separate groups of connected    clients (excluding the central government), in addition to the groups of connected clients formed    in accordance with the alternative approach (see scenario CG 4 in the annex).	20. In line with the last sentence of the last subparagraph of Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU)    No 575/2013, this section of the guidelines is also applicable to regional governments or local    authorities to which Article 115(2) of that Regulation applies, and natural or legal persons directly    controlled by or interconnected with these regional governments or local authorities.	0
229. Credit institutions should strongly consider classifying foreclosed assets as non-current       assets held for sale under IFRS 5. This accounting treatment implies that the asset must be       available for immediate sale in its present condition (IFRS 5.7), that the management body       should approve an individual plan to sell the asset within a short timeframe (normally one       year) and that an active sales policy should be pursued (IFRS 5.8); thus, it favours recoveries.	   230. Foreclosed assets received should be valued at the lower of:	0
Alignment with the supervisory reporting framework	The supervisory reporting framework and in particular the ITS on non-performing exposures and forbearance defines these concepts, which are related to the quality of assets and obligors. As the industry has requested on several occasions that supervisory reporting be aligned with the prudential framework this was taken into consideration in the specification of these GL. The following main options were considered:	0

The BSG welcomed common and harmonised indicators are established among the different Member States to guarantee a level playing field in the application of the sale of business tool. Nevertheless, it pointed out that each sale of business tool is different and should be allowed some leeway, in particular with respect to the circumstances that determine prices and market conditions.	The BSG also approved of elements that enable authorities to choose the best buyer and to use the resolution financing arrangement to facilitate the sale of a business, which could limit the tail risk and generate value for the tax payers.	0

Nevertheless, option b might still lead to higher default rates, although the impact would be significantly different for different institutions. For this reason option c was also taken into consideration. Under this option institutions would be able to choose whether it was appropriate in their situation to align the definitions. The way to achieve this alignment would be specified in the GL.	Under option d the status quo would remain, with the majority of institutions not having the definitions aligned and uncertainty existing regarding the relation between the prudential and reporting frameworks.	0
         (b) the Standardised Approach for credit risk by virtue of the reference to Article 178 in              Article 127 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.	7. Institutions that have received permission to use the IRB Approach should apply the    requirements set out in these guidelines for the IRB Approach to all exposures. Where those    institutions have received prior permission to permanently use the Standardised Approach in    accordance with Article 150 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, or permission to implement the    IRB Approach sequentially in accordance with Article 148 of that Regulation, may apply the    requirements set out in these guidelines for the Standardised Approach for the relevant    exposures under permanent partial use of the Standardised Approach or included in the    sequential implementation plan.	0
12. Guidelines set out in section 4.4 should be considered as supplementing and further     specifying the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) referred to in Article 97 and     107(1)(a) of Directive 2013/36/EU, in particular with regard to the assessment of credit risk     management and controls and accounting for expected credit losses.

197. For prudential purposes, credit institutions should update valuations of all secured       exposures in accordance with the requirements of Article 208(3) and Article 210(c) of       Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.	   198. The group of collaterals that are subject to individual valuations and revaluations on a       regular basis should be updated at the time when the exposure is classified as nonperforming and at least annually while it continues to be classified as such. Credit institutions       should make sure that, for the collateral subject to indexation or other similar methods, the       indexation is updated at least annually.	0
5. Accompanying documents	5.1 Cost-benefit analysis/impact assessment Article 16(2) of the EBA Regulation provides that, where appropriate, the EBA should analyse ‘the related potential costs and benefits’ of guidelines issued by the EBA. Such analysis shall be proportionate in relation to the scope, nature and impact of the guidelines. The following section provides an impact assessment (‘IA’) of the guidelines. It includes an overview of the findings regarding the problem to be dealt with, the solutions and the potential impact of these options.	0
    C.

1. Executive summary These guidelines provide harmonised definitions and templates for the funding plans of credit institutions mainly as a response to the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) Recommendation 2012/02( 1 ) on the funding of credit institutions and, in particular, Recommendation A.4, addressed to the EBA, to facilitate the reporting of funding plans.	In summary, the EBA is introducing a set of templates in spreadsheet format that contain harmonised definitions of the data items to be reported by institutions to their competent authorities, and from the latter to the EBA. The set of templates and definitions will assist the competent authorities in assessing the feasibility of the funding plans of credit institutions, and their impact on the supply of credit to the real economy, as well as enabling the EBA to discharge its duty to coordinate the assessment of funding plans at Union level, and assess the viability of these plans for the Union banking system.	0

22. In order to ensure a timely recognition of credit losses, credit institutions should consider     forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. When considering forwardlooking information, credit institutions should apply sound judgement consistent with     generally accepted methods for economic analysis and forecasting, and supported by a     sufficient set of data.	23. Credit institutions should be able to demonstrate how they have considered relevant,     reasonable and supportable information in the ECL assessment and measurement process.     Credit institutions should apply experienced credit judgement in the consideration of future     scenarios and take into account the potential consequence of events occurring or not     occurring, and the resulting impact on the measurement of ECL. Information should not be     excluded from that process simply because an event has a low likelihood of occurring or the     effect of that event on the credit risk or the amount of expected credit losses is uncertain. In     certain circumstances information relevant to the assessment and measurement of credit risk     may not be reasonable and supportable and should therefore be excluded from the ECL     assessment and measurement process. Given that these circumstances would be exceptional     in nature, credit institutions should provide a clearly documented, robust justification.	0
In this case also it is assumed that the threshold should be set by institutions but it captures mainly those situations where the change in the net present value (NPV) of the contract results from technical discounting aspects and rounding of the amounts and where the diminished obligation by forgiveness, or postponement of principal, interest or, where relevant fees should consequently not be considered material. Therefore, taking into account that Article 178(3)(d) of the CRR only refers to cases where an institution has already consented to a distressed restructuring, the cap threshold specified in the guidelines is lower than in the case of the sale of exposures.	Furthermore, where the difference as described in the previous paragraphs is below the specified threshold, institutions should still assess such exposures for possible other indications of unlikeliness to pay. The general principles for the identification of default apply also for distressed restructuring. Therefore, where the institution has reasonable doubts with regard to the likeliness of repayment of the obligation according to the new arrangement in full in a timely manner, the obligor should be considered defaulted. The indicators that may suggest that this is the case include a large balloon payment, a significantly higher repayment burden envisaged at the end of the repayment schedule and a significant grace period, as well as a situation where the exposure has been restructured multiple times.	0
Of the total number of credit institutions in the EU, 156 credit institutions submit supervisory data under IFRS Standards on a consolidated basis 43. Although this number is low compared with the total number of credit institutions in the EU (only 3%), these credit institutions on aggregate represent EUR 32.5 trillion or 75% of the total assets of all credit institutions in the EU as of	31 December 2014, representing on average 64% of total assets and ranging between 27% and 100% of ‘total assets’ across Member States. In addition, loans and advances of these credit institutions represent 53% of the total assets for the sample of 156 credit institutions, being on average 61% of ‘total assets’ and ranging between 27% and 81% of total assets across Member States. Therefore, IFRS Standards are applied in a significant part of the total number of credit institutions in the EU, covering the majority of the total assets of all credit institutions. For these credit institutions, loans and advances are a significant component — if not the most significant in some cases — of their total assets.	0

77. It is expected that the institution would have a limited number of obligors who default soon     after returning to a non-defaulted status. In the case of extensive number of multiple defaults     the institution should revise its policies with regard to the reclassification of exposures.	78. The analysis of the changes in statuses of the obligors or facilities should in particular be     taken into account for the purpose of specifying the periods referred to in paragraphs 71 and	0
32. The GL foresee an exception to this rule for the small Payment Institutions (PIs) and Electronic     money Institutions (EMIs) that, under the national transposition of Article 32 PSD2 and Article 9 of     the Electronic money Directive (EMD), would be able to benefit from an exemption. These PSPs     would need to report only annually with a half-yearly breakdown. This has led to changes to GL	3.1, 3.2 and 7 in the set of GL addressed to PSPs. CAs have to provide data to the ECB and the EBA     within six months after the end of the reporting period, irrespective of whether that period is semiannual (for most PSPs) or annual (for small PIs and EMIs). The GL do not specify the timeline for     PSPs to provide data to CAs, given that CAs use different methodologies and timelines in their     existing payment statistics collection.	0
    c) have in place policies and methodologies to ensure the measurement of impairments and        write-offs for timely recognition of impairments and write-offs.	   243. Competent authorities should ensure that credit institutions have appropriate written       policies and procedures in place regarding the valuation of property, as described in       section 9. In particular, competent authorities should verify that these policies cover all       immovable and movable property types that are used to secure credit exposures, the criteria       for the application of individual versus indexed valuation and the requirements with regard to       eligible appraisers.	0
         (e) the conditions referred to in points (a) to (d) should be met also with regard to new              exposures to the obligor, in particular where the previous defaulted exposures to this              obligor were sold or written off.	    Institutions may apply the period referred to in point (a) to all exposures or apply different     periods for different types of exposures.	0

13. The EBA concurs with the views expressed by the respondents in support of consistency     between regulations applicable to remuneration policies and practices. In this context, the     EBA underlines that the separate EBA Guidelines on sound remuneration policies applicable     to credit institutions and investment firms5 are aimed at ensuring that remuneration policies     regarding staff whose activities have a material impact on the risk profile of institutions are     based on sound governance processes, take into account the risk strategy and profile of the     institutions and align incentives of this type of staff with the interests of the institutions,     shareholders, investors and other stakeholders in the institution, as well as the public.     Furthermore, the EBA Guidelines on remuneration for sales staff are applicable to     institutions other than credit institutions and aim to align remuneration incentives with the     interests of consumers, in order to avoid remuneration becoming a driver of mis-selling and     consumer detriment.	14. The EBA has ensured that none of the present Guidelines are in conflict with the EBA     Guidelines on sound remuneration policies, and none of the respondents provided any     example of inconsistency. The EBA can therefore confirm that, in respect of the obligations of     credit institutions, the implementation of these Guidelines is without prejudice to their     compliance with EBA/GL/2015/22, and this has been clarified in the ‘Subject matter and     scope of application’ section of the final Guidelines accordingly. The EBA also provided     further clarifications on the application of these Guidelines to credit institutions in relation to     the EBA Guidelines on sound remuneration policies in the detailed feedback table provided     in chapter 4.2.	0

      3. The EBA’s risk analysis, supported by similar research conducted by other international          organisations, indicated that high levels of NPEs are a drag on profitability and are strongly          correlated with weak lending growth. The effects of high levels of NPEs on banks’ balance          sheets on, inter alia, funding costs and capital and profitability can seriously jeopardise          institutions’ ability to run a viable and sustainable business model.	      4. NPEs are a problem at multiple levels: at microprudential level, high levels of NPEs are          associated with lower profitability and lower efficiency; at macroprudential level, high levels          of NPEs are connected with stagnant growth, as capital is tied up in NPEs and there is          decreased new lending into the real economy. In addition, high stocks of NPEs negatively          affect the resilience of the banking sector to shocks and hence increase systemic risk. Finally,          for consumers, an inability to meet the obligations of the credit contract could have a          detrimental impact on their financial situation and social circumstances. All of these effects          must be tackled in a comprehensive manner.	0

8. The EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, has reviewed and assessed the responses, and has    identified in the process approximately 200 different issues or requests for clarification that    respondents had raised. Section 3.2 presents an assessment of the four main concerns that were    raised, while the feedback table in section 5.2 provides an exhaustive and comprehensive    assessment of all of the comments that the EBA received and any changes that the EBA decided to    make to the GL as a result, where applicable. Section 4, in turn, presents the final GL themselves.	    3.2 Rationale	0
3. National supervisory authorities and other authorities with a macro-prudential mandate are recommended to assess the impact of credit institutions’ funding plans on the flow of credit to the real economy.	4. The EBA is recommended to develop guidelines on harmonised templates and definitions, in accordance with its established consultation practices, in order to facilitate the reporting of funding plans for the purposes of the recommendations contained in paragraphs 1 to 3 above.	0
63. Institutions should have adequate policies and procedures to identify credit frauds. Typically     when credit fraud is identified, the exposure is already defaulted on the basis of material     delays in payment. However, if the credit fraud is identified before default has been     recognised this should be treated as an additional indication of unlikeliness to pay.	Governance processes regarding unlikeliness to pay	0
    bank secrecy or other legislation resulting in inconsistencies in the identification of default of     an obligor, institutions should inform their competent authorities of these legal impediments     and, if they use the IRB Approach they should also estimate the materiality of the     inconsistencies in the identification of default of an obligor and their possible impact on the     estimates of risk parameters.	82. Further, where the identification of default of an obligor in a manner fully consistent across     the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries is very burdensome, requiring     development of a centralised database of all clients or implementation of other mechanisms     or procedures to verify the status of each client at all entities within the group, institutions     need not apply such mechanisms or procedures if they can demonstrate that the effect of     non-compliance is immaterial because there are no or very limited number of common clients     among the relevant entities within a group and the exposure to these clients is immaterial.	0

75.The review and validation results and any recommendations on model usage should be    presented to and approved by the management body or its delegates. Upon approval, the model    should be subject to ongoing review, process verification and validation at a frequency that is    consistent with the level of model risk determined and approved by the institution.	76.The ongoing review process should establish a set of exception trigger events that obligate the    model reviewers to notify the management body or its delegates in a timely fashion, in order to    determine corrective actions and restrictions on model usage.

Objectives and the alignment with other instruments	11. The respondents generally agreed with the objectives listed in the CP but stated that it was unclear     whether a direct link between these GL and the Regulatory technical standards on strong customer     authentication and common and secure open standards for communication (RTS on SCA and CSC)     existed or not. Some supported such a link while others did not, putting forward arguments     accordingly.	0
20. Many of the respondents to the consultation considered that the EBA should clarify that PSPs     should also be considered ‘other interested parties’ for the purpose of the Guidelines and that     PSPs should be able to make use of the complaints procedures introduced in PSD2 and further     specified through the Guidelines. FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON PROCEDURES FOR COMPLAINTS OF ALLEGED INFRINGEMENTS OF DIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/2366	21. Article 99(1) of PSD2 refers to ‘other interested parties including consumer associations’,     without making any additional specification, which means the reference to consumer     associations is not exhaustive.	0
7. These guidelines are addressed to competent authorities as defined in point (i) of Article 4(2)    of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and to financial institutions as defined in Article 4(1) of    Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.	Definitions	0
17.The alternative approach permits a separate assessment only for ‘natural or legal persons’ directly    controlled by or directly interconnected with the central government. Furthermore, this    alternative approach is not possible for further substructures, i.e. for natural or legal persons    solely indirectly controlled by or indirectly interconnected with the central government. Instead,    such entities are to be included in the group of connected clients for the entity directly controlled    by or directly interconnected with the central government.	18.Nonetheless, applying the alternative approach for exposures to central governments and entities    directly controlled by or interconnected with them does not allow connections on the level below    the central government to be disregarded. Economic dependencies among such entities need to    be reflected in separate groups of connected clients (not including the central government). The    alternative approach looks only at the relationship between the central government and entities    directly connected to it. The idiosyncratic risk that might arise in the relationship among such    entities needs to be assessed separately.	0

11. Analysis conducted by EBA staff for a sample of 56 major EU banks resident in 21 jurisdictions     based on public statements estimates litigation and misconduct costs amounting to     EUR 75 billion since 2009. The EBA’s assessment confirms remuneration policies and     practices and misaligned incentives of sales staff to be a relevant driver of conduct risk in the     banking sector.	12. More specifically, one national authority reported that by end July 2015 (since January 2011),     banks in that Member State had paid out approximately EUR 27.8 billion in refunds and     compensation as a result of mis-selling of payment protection insurance. According to the     same source, in the first half of 2015 almost 740 000 new complaints were opened in relation     to banking and credit card products. Almost 280 000 of those complaints were related to the     advising, selling and arranging of those products31.	0

       A. Problem identification	The duration-based calculation of general risk is one methodology that the EU institutions may follow to calculate own funds requirements against general risk on debt instruments. 14 Prepayment risk refers to an early unscheduled return of principal and the specifications of the duration-based calculation under Article 340 of the CRR do not account for this risk. The core problem that the current guidelines aim to address is the risk associated with the uncertainty around the return of principal on a fixed-income security, and in this case on debt instruments.	0
The BSG points out that many of the suggested changes will require significant system changes as well as changes in the calibration and will in many cases require redevelopment of internal models. It is therefore requested that significant time is allowed for the adoption of the new regulations in order for institutions to be able to handle all necessary changes and to obtain supervisory approval for the changes made. It is also considered essential to implement the new definition of default at the same time as the review of all internal rating methodologies. One of the particular challenges for implementation mentioned by the BSG is the counting of days past due. It is suggested that in some situations identification of default at month-end only should be allowed.	Specific issues	0

Article 22(1) and (2) of Directive 2013/34/EU sets out several options and national discretions for    Member States as regards the transposition of such provisions, thus leaving the definition of    ‘group’ for the purpose of consolidation of accounts to the Member States. Consequently, the    definition of ‘control’ for the purpose of forming groups of connected clients will also depend on    the national transposition of these options and national discretions. The present guidelines    regarding the ‘control’ criterion respect the national transpositions of Directive 2013/34/EU,    which may potentially lead to different grouping requirements depending on where institutions’    clients are required to prepare their consolidated financial statements.	0

Sale of the credit obligation	41. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (c) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should take into account both the character and     materiality of the loss related to the sale of credit obligations, in accordance with the     following paragraphs. Transactions of traditional securitisation with significant risk transfer     and any intragroup sales of credit obligations should be considered sale of credit obligations.	0
The scope of the guidelines on the identification of exposures associated with high risk	The exclusion of several exposure classes from the scope of these guidelines was discussed. In particular, it was proposed that exposures to central governments or central banks, exposures to regional governments and local authorities and exposures to public sector entities be excluded from the scope of the guidelines with the rationale that such exposures are not expected to be exposed to a high risk of loss. In this regard, it should be noted that Article 128(3) CRR cannot be limited to certain exposure classes and that therefore this article applies to the above outlined exposure classes as well. Moreover, it should be noted that in practice it is very improbable that any exposure stemming from these exposure classes will fall under the types of exposures described in paragraph 3, 4, 5 or 6 of these guidelines.	0

d. threshold for the materiality of the economic loss defined by the institutions.	Not introducing a threshold would be a conservative approach to the recognition of defaults. However, the major weakness of option a is that the treatment of all sales of credit obligations with a loss as defaults, even if the loss is close to zero, would underestimate the loss given default and, similarly, it would overestimate the probability of default, as the occurrence of identified defaults would increase. Setting the threshold at zero would also effectively lead to ignoring the materiality requirement in terms of the credit-related economic loss associated with the sale of a credit obligation in accordance with Article 178(3)(c) of the CRR.	0

Costs: In the absence of the proposed regulatory intervention (option 1.1), increased use of judgement in the application of principles-based accounting requirements related to credit risk under IFRS 9 would be a source of prudential concern. This could result in a low-quality and inconsistent implementation of IFRS 9, and therefore in inadequate levels of ECL allowances relative to the credit risk of the loan portfolios — for instance if credit institutions minimise the effort to consider forward-looking information, which is a central feature of an expected credit loss model. This can have an adverse effect on the comparability of financial statements and the capital adequacy of credit institutions. These adverse effects would be amplified by the unlevelplaying field that will exist across credit institutions at an international level, when the BCBS guidance is applied at an international level, but no equivalent regulation has been developed in the EU. Therefore, the policy objectives of these guidelines would not be met.	In terms of the extent of the use of IFRS Standards across credit institutions in the EU, the EBA estimated the number of credit institutions applying IFRS Standards on a consolidated basis (table of data by Member State at the end of section D1). These estimates are based on data for each Member State published by the ECB 37, the supervisory data submitted by credit institutions 38 (FINREP) and EBA aggregated statistical data 39, with some adjustments/simplifications where data were not readily available.	0

60. The ECL assessment approach used should be the most appropriate in the particular     circumstances, and typically should be aligned with how the credit institution manages the     lending exposure. For example, collective assessment is often used for large groups of     homogeneous lending exposures with shared credit risk characteristics, such as retail     portfolios. Individual assessments are often conducted for significant exposures, or where     credit concerns have been identified at the individual loan level, such as watch list and past     due loans.	                                                                                                30 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS’ CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES	0

At the same time it also clear, just like with delta profit and loss approximations used for options, that the delta estimation of change in value (the MD in our example) is more accurate for small changes (i.e. when we are close to the current price of the bond) and is less precise when we try to assess large movements.	Nevertheless, the change in IRR would also affect the MD calculation, just like a movement in the underlying of an option affects its delta. Accordingly, if the MD is recalculated after every movement in IRR, we will observe a closer relationship between the ‘real’ and the ‘estimated’ profit and loss. This can be seen in Graph 3, which represent ‘real’ and ‘estimated’ losses on the price of the bond used previously in case of an increase of 1% in IRR. It may also be observed that the loss based on the MD is consistently higher than the real one.	0

Duration-based metrics would be generally conservative for directionally-long portfolios, while they might underestimate potential losses for directionally-short portfolios. Regardless of this, the Standardised Approach does not include any adjustment to correct convexity; however, the convexity stemming from any embedded optionality should be considered in these guidelines when calculating any correction to the modified duration.	2.1 EBA mandate The concept of Modified Duration, as exposed in the introduction and defined according to the formulas in Article 340(3) of the CRR, is valid only for instruments not subject to prepayment risk. Accordingly, a correction to the duration becomes necessary to reflect this risk.	0
65. Credit institutions should have robust policies and procedures in place to appropriately     validate the accuracy and consistency of the models used to assess the credit risk and     measure ECL, including their model-based credit risk rating systems and processes and the     estimation of all relevant risk components, at the outset of model usage and on an ongoing     basis. Such policies and procedures should appropriately include the role of professional     judgement.	                                                                                               31 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS’ CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES	0

     5.4.4         Liquidation activities	     116. If no sustainable restructuring solution can be reached, credit institutions should still         resolve the NPE.

Where the price obtained from the foreclosure of immovable         property affects the amount owed by a consumer, credit institutions should take into         account, when deciding on the liquidation measure and next steps, the provisions of         Article 17(5) of Directive 2014/17/EU,31 to the extent applicable.	0

      4. NPEs are a problem at multiple levels: at microprudential level, high levels of NPEs are          associated with lower profitability and lower efficiency; at macroprudential level, high levels          of NPEs are connected with stagnant growth, as capital is tied up in NPEs and there is          decreased new lending into the real economy. In addition, high stocks of NPEs negatively          affect the resilience of the banking sector to shocks and hence increase systemic risk. Finally,          for consumers, an inability to meet the obligations of the credit contract could have a          detrimental impact on their financial situation and social circumstances. All of these effects          must be tackled in a comprehensive manner.	      5. In 2014, in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 on supervisory reporting          the EBA introduced definitions of NPEs and forborne exposures (FBEs) to facilitate the          identification of problematic assets. Despite the decreasing trend in levels of NPEs in most          EU Member States, the pace of reduction of NPLs has been slow. This slow pace of reduction          is mainly due to the discretion allowed banks’ management and supervisors, together with          the absence of an effective secondary market for NPEs and challenging legal systems, which          have incentivised credit institutions to keep the loans on their balance sheets.	0

9.      The level of improvement in consumers’ abilities to meet their financial commitments has         therefore been small across the 28 MS. Of the 32 states included in the statistics, 14 had         arrears levels equal to or in excess of the level for the 28 MS in 2013 (11.8% of the         population); 11 states had arrears levels less than the 2013 level and figures for the         remaining seven states were unavailable. For the 25 states where figures for both 2012 and         2013 were available, the level of arrears increased in 12 states, decreased in 12 states and         remained unchanged in one state. The statistics suggest that in the majority of states         household arrears remain above the level for the 28 MS, thus suggesting that this remains a         concern in those states.	10. While the level of arrears outlined above has largely been constant in the period 2010 to     2013, this trend may not be indicative of the trend for arrears going forward. The trend to     date must be considered in the context of the current low interest rate environment and the     positive impact this has on consumers’ ability to meet their credit commitments by     maintaining or reducing their required payments. Current Eurozone and non-Eurozone     interest rates are exceptionally low. While positive for borrowers a low interest rate     environment has a negative effect on savers and pensioners and as such current interest     levels are unsustainable.

31 December 2014, representing on average 64% of total assets and ranging between 27% and 100% of ‘total assets’ across Member States. In addition, loans and advances of these credit institutions represent 53% of the total assets for the sample of 156 credit institutions, being on average 61% of ‘total assets’ and ranging between 27% and 81% of total assets across Member States. Therefore, IFRS Standards are applied in a significant part of the total number of credit institutions in the EU, covering the majority of the total assets of all credit institutions. For these credit institutions, loans and advances are a significant component — if not the most significant in some cases — of their total assets.	In addition, according to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 44, Member States may require or permit the application of IFRS Standards to the consolidated financial statements of entities whose securities do not trade in a regulated securities market or to the annual financial statements (traded on regulated markets or otherwise). In particular, as indicated by the latest stock-take of the Commission in December 2013 on the use of the options provided in Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 45, in some Member States, IFRS Standards are mandatorily applied for all or some types of entities in their consolidated financial statements (16 Member States) and individual financial statements (13 Member States). In the majority of Member States (all but six Member States), entities may apply IFRS Standards on a voluntary basis. In many cases where IFRS Standards are required, credit institutions are among the types of entities to which IFRS mandatorily apply. Therefore, across Member States, more credit institutions than those applying IFRS Standards for supervisory reporting 46 apply IFRS, and these guidelines are also relevant to these credit institutions. In addition, in some Member States’ credit institutions may apply IFRS Standards only for supervisory reporting (financial statements will be prepared under national GAAP).	0

As of 31 December 2014, 5 906 credit institution 40 in the EU reported EUR 43.7 trillion of total assets. These credit institutions may use IFRS Standards or other accounting frameworks (for example national accounting standards 41). In addition, the sum of loans and advances for all credit institutions represents 55% of the total assets, being on average 64% of total assets and ranging between 38% and 77% of ‘total assets’ across Member States. Therefore, the subject matter of these guidelines is relevant to a significant component — if not the most significant in some cases — of the total assets of a credit institution 42.	37       ECB    Statistical  Data    Warehouse         (Consolidated     banking     data    current),    available     at http://sdw.ecb.int/browse.do?node=9689600. 38    Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 of 16 April 2014 laying down implementing technical standards with regard to supervisory reporting of institutions according to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council Text with EEA relevance (OJ L 191, 28.6.2014, p. 1-1861), available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2014_191_R_0001. 39      http://www.eba.europa.eu/supervisory-convergence/supervisory-disclosure/aggregate-statistical-data 40   The total number of credit institutions includes entities at different levels of consolidation under the CRR scope of consolidation (individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated levels). 41   Some credit institutions applying national GAAP may also be part of a group that apply IFRS Standards on a consolidated basis and therefore will also need to apply IFRS Standards to provide the data at the consolidated level. 42   In addition, these guidelines also apply to loan commitments given and financial guarantee contracts given, and therefore a larger amount of exposures are subject to IFRS.	0

Competent authorities should treat complaints from the same complainant, about the        same payment service provider and with the same description of the situation that gave        rise to the complaint, as a single complaint for the purposes of the aggregate analysis of        complaints referred to in Guideline 4.1.

   190. All valuations of immovable property, including updated valuations, should be performed       by an independent and qualified appraiser, internal or external, who possesses the necessary       qualifications, ability and experience to execute a valuation, as specified in Article 208(3)(b)       and Article 229 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.	   191. For the purposes of external appraisals, credit institutions should establish a panel of       independent and qualified appraisers, based on the criteria set out below. The appraisers’	0
          of the guidelines may be more relevant for loans and advances than for debt securities or           off-balance-sheet exposures and, similarly, some parts are focused on specific counterparty           sectors (households, small and medium-sized enterprises, corporates).	      30.These guidelines should be read in conjunction with and without prejudice to other relevant          EBA products, in particular the EBA Guidelines on internal governance (EBA/GL/2017/11),          the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP          (EBA/GL/2014/13 and EBA/GL/2018/03), the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management          practices and accounting for expected credit losses (EBA/GL/2017/06) and the joint ESMA          and EBA Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management          body and key function holders (EBA/GL/2017/12).	0

178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. All detected errors that led to technical past due     situation should be rectified by institutions in the shortest timeframe possible.	    In the case of institutions that use the IRB Approach, technical past due situations should be     removed from the reference data set of defaulted exposures for the purpose of estimation of     risk parameters.	0
     5.2.3         Grouping exposures	     73.The EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting for expected credit         losses25 describe the policies for credit institutions of grouping exposures with shared credit         risk characteristics. Homogeneous portfolios should be built up in order to tailor treatments         specifically to NPEs. Credit institutions should consider designing customised processes for         each portfolio, with a dedicated expert team taking ownership of each. NPE portfolios should         be analysed with a high degree of granularity, resulting in clearly defined borrower         subportfolios. For these analyses, credit institutions should develop appropriate         management information systems and sufficiently high data quality.	0
Title I – Subject matter, scope and definitions	1. These guidelines seek to establish consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices        by harmonising templates and definitions, to facilitate the reporting of funding plans from        credit institutions to competent authorities to ensure there is compliance with        paragraphs 1–4     of    Recommendation A         of     the    ESRB     Recommendations        of 20 December 2012 on funding plans of credit institutions (‘ESRB Recommendations’        and ‘ESRB Recommendation A’).	0
26. If, for example, an EBA authority is not designated as competent for ensuring the application     and enforcement of the main provisions of Directive 2014/17/EU to which the Guidelines     relate, and only has the cooperation responsibility referred to above, then only the     Information Requirements set out in Paragraph 2 of the Addressee Section of the Guidelines     (‘Information Requirements’) are addressed to that EBA authority.	27. In that case the EBA authority can consider itself compliant with the Guidelines if it complies     with the Information Requirements. The Information Requirements have been added to the     Guidelines in order to encourage all competent authorities to apply consistent supervisory     practices and ensure common application of Directive 2014/17/EU, while recognising that     the structure of the Directive is such that the Guidelines can only be addressed directly to     EBA authorities. Other competent authorities cannot be made subject to the same ‘comply     or explain’ obligations that apply to EBA authorities, and so the Information Requirements     encourage them to apply the Guidelines on a voluntary basis.	0
      It should be noted that, although detailed, this example is still simplified, as, for example,       according to paragraph 30 of the final GL the institution would need to ensure that the applied       methodology for downturn LGD estimation appropriately reflects a potential downturn effect       on all relevant components of economic loss. The example above, however, considered only       recoveries. Where necessary the institution could for example estimate the impact on the cure       rate (i.e. the rate of exposures returning to the performing portfolio) by applying an       extrapolation approach.	                                                                                                    30 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN	0

In addition, at an international level, in December 2015, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (‘BCBS’) issued supervisory guidance on credit risk and accounting for expected credit losses (the ‘BCBS guidance’), which sets out supervisory expectations for credit institutions related to sound credit risk practices associated with implementing and applying an ECL accounting model and specific guidance for credit institutions applying IFRS Standards.

According to Article 9(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU, the competent authorities shall require that    each recovery plan includes a framework of indicators established by the institution which    identifies the points at which appropriate actions referred to in the plan may be taken. The    framework of indicators should be included in the recovery plans developed pursuant to the    regulatory technical standard on the content of recovery plans developed pursuant to    Article 5(10) of Directive 2014/59/EU.	0
     6.2.6         Forbearance targets and monitoring	     144. Forbearance contracts and documentation should include a well-defined borrower target         schedule, detailing all necessary targets to be achieved by the borrower in order to repay the         exposure over the course of the contract term. These milestones/targets should be credible,         be appropriately conservative and take account of any potential deterioration in the         borrower’s financial situation. The performance of the forborne borrower, including the         borrower’s compliance with all agreed targets, should be closely monitored by the NPE WU         responsible for granting the forbearance, at least for the duration of the probation period.	0

Subsequently, institutions should assess whether the identified groups of connected    clients need to be (partially) connected themselves (e.g. whether groups of clients connected on    account of economic dependency need to be grouped together with a control group).	32.In their assessment, institutions should consider each case separately, i.e. identify the possible    chain of contagion (‘domino effect’) based on the individual circumstances (see scenarios C/E 1    and C/E 2 in the annex).	0

178 of the CRR, any situation that leads to a material delay in payment or unlikeliness to pay should be considered default and the concept of technical default cannot overrule this requirement. Nevertheless, many of the specific concerns expressed by the respondents were addressed in the guidelines through clarifications on the calculation of days past due, rather than through changes to the definition of technical defaults. These clarifications related in particular to the treatment of disputes over credit obligations.	                                                                                                   71 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT	0

In the absence of any    notification by this deadline, competent authorities will be considered by the EBA to be noncompliant . Notifications should be sent by submitting the form available on the EBA website    to compliance@eba.europa.eu with the reference ‘EBA/GL/201x/xx’. Notifications should be    submitted by persons with appropriate authority to report compliance on behalf of their    competent authorities.

3. Not all Member States (MS) currently collect fraud data for all payment instruments, and those    that do tend to use different definitions of what a fraudulent payment transaction is, different    methodologies and/or different data breakdowns. In particular, MS that currently do collect fraud    data either do not cover transactions using all payment instruments or transactions made through    all types of payment service providers (PSPs) within their jurisdiction, or the data categories and/or    level of detail differs.	4. The European System of Central Banks (ESCB), in its function as overseer of payment schemes and    instruments, collects fraud data too, but those data are limited to card payments and based on    non-legally binding reporting requirements. Additional payment statistics are collected by the ECB,    with the assistance of the euro area national central banks, from euro area PSPs and these include    data on all means of payments but do not, at the moment, include reporting of data related to    fraudulent payment transactions. 1	0

PSP                payment service provider FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON PROCEDURES FOR COMPLAINTS OF ALLEGED INFRINGEMENTS OF DIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/2366	2. Executive Summary Article 100(6) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on Payment Services in the Internal Market (PSD2) requires the European Banking Authority (EBA), after consulting the European Central Bank (ECB), to issue Guidelines addressed to the competent authorities (CAs) under PSD2 on the complaints procedures to be taken into consideration to ensure and monitor effective compliance with PSD2. Article 99(1) of PSD2 further specifies that Member States shall ensure that procedures are set up which allow payment service users and other interested parties including consumer associations, to submit complaints to the CAs with regard to payment service providers’ (PSPs’) alleged infringements of PSD2. To fulfil this mandate, the EBA assessed existing complaints procedures that had been established by CAs pursuant to Article 80 of Directive 2007/64/EC (PSD1) and took them into account in the process of development of the Consultation Paper which was issued in February 2017. The EBA received 12 responses to the consultation from various types of market participants. While the majority of the respondents were supportive of the proposed Guidelines, some of them suggested more substantive amendments and clarifications to be made in relation to the channels for submission of complaints, the information requested from complainants, the scope of application of the Guidelines and the aggregate analysis of complaints. As a result of the assessment of the main arguments presented in the responses, the EBA introduced the following changes to the content of the Guidelines:	0

     8. In this context, it should be noted that the GL on PD and LGD estimation define the estimation         of risk parameters as including risk differentiation and risk quantification, and that in this sense         these GL on downturn LGD treat only the risk quantification part of downturn LGD estimation.         The GL on PD and LGD envisage this interpretation of downturn LGD estimate by defining LGD         calibration as:	         The part of the process of the estimation of risk parameters which leads to appropriate risk          quantification by ensuring that the LGD estimates correspond to the long-run average LGD, or          to the downturn LGD estimate where this is more conservative, at the level relevant for the          applied method. 7	0

                                      𝛼 where 𝑡1−𝛼,𝑛−2 denotes the 1 − 2 percentile of the Student t-distribution, which would then have to            2 be taken into account in the quantification of a Category A MoC for that extrapolation.	    66.It may be the case that only for a major share of economic loss the impact of a considered        downturn period can be estimated by a haircut or extrapolation approach. There may,        however, be other, less significant (but not immaterial), components of economic loss where        the impact of the downturn period under consideration can be estimated by neither a haircut        nor an extrapolation approach. In order not to push these cases under the scope of application        of section 7, the EBA considers it appropriate to allow an estimation of the impact on these        less significant components based on observed data from a different period than from the        downturn period under consideration, yet still with the objective of estimating the impact of        the downturn period under consideration. This is included in paragraph 32(b)(ii) of the draft        GL.	0
already high risk items under Article 128(2) CRR) as high risk exposures if there are indications that there is a risk of a high loss (e.g. because of insufficient market liquidity and/or high price volatility for the financed object that is not yet sufficiently mitigated by pre-sales contracts for example, and there is insufficient other income and assets of the obligor for mitigating the loss risk for the financing institution). As an example, an institution could decide to finance speculative investments in mobile property (e.g. ships, containers or cars), in agricultural products or even in intangible assets, such as licenses or patents.	Paragraph 5(b) provides that, in their assessment of high risk items, institutions should consider exposures that are similar to specialised lending exposures as being potentially high risk exposures. In particular, in cases in which such exposures relate to a single project in its pre-operational phase and where the cash flows serve as security and as source of repayment at the same time, institutions should assess whether or not these exposures exhibit a high risk of loss. However, it should be noted that such exposures are not high risk by definition, but that paragraph 5(b) also requires that the institution considers such a project of no high quality in order for it to be characterised as a high risk item.	0
     9. In order to improve clarity in the GL text where it refers to the calibration target used for         downturn LGD estimation and where it refers to the downturn LGD estimates by facility grade         or pool, the following terminology is used throughout the text:	         Quantification of downturn LGD: the term quantification of downturn LGD covers all elements          of the quantification of downturn LGD including the quantification of the calibration target,          the quantification of the resulting downturn LGD estimates at grade and pool level and the          quantification of MoC.	0
78. The objective of public disclosures is to provide decision-useful information on a credit     institution’s financial position and performance, and changes therein, to a wide range of users     in a clear and understandable manner. Credit institutions should aim to provide information     that is relevant and comparable so that users can make timely, informed decisions and are     able to evaluate the stewardship of management body and senior management.	79. Financial and credit risk management disclosures should be made in accordance with the     applicable accounting and supervisory frameworks 26. Credit institutions should provide the     disclosures needed to fairly depict a credit institutions’s exposure to credit risk, including its     ECL estimates, and to provide relevant information on a credit institution’s underwriting     practices.	0

1  Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/78/EC, (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p.12).	                                                                                                                 3 GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING ACTIVITIES	0
   220. All credit institutions should develop their own liquidation cost and market price discount       assumptions based on observed empirical evidence. If insufficient empirical evidence is       available, discount assumptions should be based on, at a minimum, liquidity, passage of time,       and the quality/ageing of the appraisal. If a credit institution faces the situation of a frozen       property market and only a small number of properties have been sold or the sales history       has to be considered insufficient, a more conservative market price discount should apply.	9.4 Further considerations on estimating cash flow from property collateral liquidation	0
However, developments in recent years have shown significant cases of misconduct and misselling by staff in financial institutions, with poor remuneration policies and practices having been identified as a key underlying driver. The impact of mis-selling has been considerable, in that it has caused detriment to consumers as a result of inappropriate, unsuitable or excessively priced products; has resulted in unfair pressure exerted on sales staff; has impacted negatively on financial institutions as a result of fines, penalties, settlements, redress, compensation payouts and litigation; has undermined confidence in financial institutions and markets; and has created economic costs to society through the misallocation of resources.	While the EBA has so far issued a number of regulatory requirements to protect consumers and address conduct risks, the EBA identified a need for the development of requirements specific to the remuneration policies and practices related to the sale and provision of retail banking products and services. The Guidelines apply to remuneration paid to staff employed by credit institutions, creditors, credit intermediaries, payment institutions and electronic money institutions, when selling mortgages, personal loans, deposits, payment accounts, payment services and/or electronic money. They are aimed at providing a framework for financial institutions to implement remuneration policies and practices that will improve links between incentives and the fair treatment of consumers and reduce the risk of mis-selling and resultant conduct costs for firms.	0

18. Credit institutions should also give due consideration to the application of the principle of     materiality. However, this should not result in individual exposures or portfolios being     considered immaterial if, cumulatively, these represent a material exposure to the credit     institution. In addition, materiality should not be assessed only on the basis of the potential     impact on the profit or loss statement at the reporting date. For instance, large portfolio(s) of     lending exposures such as real estate mortgages would generally be considered material even     if they are highly collateralised.	19. In considering how to take proportionality or materiality into account in the design of an ECL     methodology or in its implementation, it is important to ensure that bias is not being     introduced.	0

4.2 General approach to be followed when establishing cooperation agreements	14. DGSs or, where appropriate, designated authorities, should adhere to the multilateral     framework cooperation agreement (MFCA) between deposit guarantee schemes in the     European Union or conclude bilateral or multilateral cooperation agreements with all other     relevant DGSs and, where appropriate, designated authorities in the EU by 8/12/2016.	0
7. Downturn LGD estimation where observed or estimated impact is not available         This section sets out a minimum aggregate MoC requirement when downturn LGD cannot be         calibrated using either of the methodologies set out in section 5 and section 6.	8. Reference value         This section lays down how to calculate the reference value to be used as a non-binding         challenger of the final downturn LGDs.	0
76. Credit risk practices should be reviewed periodically to ensure that relevant data available     throughout a credit institution’s organisation are captured and that systems are updated as     the credit institution’s underwriting or business practices change or evolve over time. A     feedback loop should be established to ensure that information on estimates of ECL, changes     in credit risk and actual losses experienced on lending exposures is shared among credit risk     experts, accounting and regulatory reporting staff, and in particular with the loan     underwriting staff.	77. The common processes, systems, tools and data mentioned above could include credit risk     rating systems, estimated PDs (subject to appropriate adjustments), past-due status, loan-tovalue ratios, historical loss rates, product type, amortisation schedule, down payment     requirements, market segment, geographical location, vintage (i.e. date of origination) and     collateral type.	0
        methodology applied to ensure that the calibration target is met. Therefore, the proposed         policy leaves flexibility with respect to the actual estimation methodology but provides         guidance on the types of approaches to be used for the quantification of the calibration target.	    4. Because of this understanding, the level at which downturn LGDs are calibrated should be at        least the same as the level at which long-run average LGDs are calculated for the purpose of        calibration. In this context, it should be recalled that the GL on PD and LGD estimation define        the notion of ‘calibration segments’ as a uniquely identified subset of the range of application        of the LGD model that is jointly calibrated. The use of calibration segments does not, however,        require institutions to calibrate LGDs at the level of calibration segments. Institutions may use        calibration segments but calibrate LGD estimates at the level of each grade or pool (e.g. if, in        the step of calibration, the portfolio under consideration is split by certain regions) within        those calibration segments. However, regardless of whether an institution calculates the longrun average LGD at the level of calibration segments or at the level of grades or pools, both        with the objective of providing LGD estimates by facility grade or pool, the quantification of        downturn LGD estimates should follow the level considered by the institution for the purpose        of calibrating LGD estimates to the long-run average LGD.	0

The inclusion of the behavioural factors aims to provide a more precise interpretation of the prepayment risk. When such factors are significant they can have a great impact on the duration of the bond. The practice is also in line with the BCBS framework on the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, where behavioural risk is defined as a risk of a change in exercise/prepayment outcomes, e.g. in fixed-rate mortgage products, due to other retail client decision motivating factors, such as demographical features and/or and other social factors, rather than pure financial gain. As well as being more accurate it also provides a more conservative approach as the factor is always positive, i.e. the corrected modified duration will increase with the factor.	Another advantage of the practice is that it does not apply a rigid specific formula and therefore gives the parties some discretion depending on the materiality of the behavioural factors. Institutions with limited portfolios and for which the behavioural factors have no historical relevance do not have to estimate the factors on a regular basis.	0
2.2 Rationale	7.   The EBA has assessed all of the responses and has arrived at the main conclusions set out      below with regard to the requirements that do and do not require amendments. They are      being presented using the structure of the Guidelines: they start with general comments      received on the scope and definitions, followed by comments received on the Guidelines,      related to the design, documentation, notification, accessibility, approval and monitoring of      remuneration policies and practices. This is followed by the EBA’s feedback on the      application date of the Guidelines in relation to recent developments in the EU regulatory      framework. Additional, more detailed, feedback is provided in the feedback table contained      in chapter 4.2.	0

     Competent authorities should also consider a credit institution’s credit risk practices when      assessing a credit institution’s overall capital adequacy.	144.   In assessing the appropriateness of the level of allowances for lending exposures as an    element of a credit institution’s overall capital adequacy, competent authorities should look    at their credit risk practices and take into account that the credit institution’s related ECL    processes, methodology and underlying assumptions require the exercise of a substantial    degree of experienced credit judgement.	0

2. Subject matter, scope and definitions Subject matter	5. These guidelines specify how to apply corrections to the calculation of the modified duration    to reflect prepayment risk, in accordance with the mandate conferred to the EBA in the last    subparagraph of Article 340(3) of Regulation (EU) No575/2013 13.	0
31.It is important to note that institutions should also collect information on all entities forming a    ‘chain of contagion’ to be able to correctly identify groups of connected clients. However, if there    are interconnections among entities with which the institution has no business relation (and thus    has not collected any information with regard to possible interconnections), the correct    identification of a group of connected clients might not be possible. Naturally, if an institution    becomes aware of such interconnections via entities outside its clientele (e.g. through press    statements), it needs to incorporate this information into its grouping practice.	32.It will rarely be possible to implement automated procedures for identifying economic    interconnections; therefore, case-by-case analysis and judgement should be used. As the    determination of economic interconnection is dependent on the one hand on the information    available to or gathered by the institution and on the other hand on economic judgement, it is    possible that different institutions will arrive at different results when analysing the same entities.    Supervisors should be aware of this issue and, depending on the specific case, may accept or    challenge such differences.	0

1.    Originator institutions should use appropriate methods and procedures to assess and       demonstrate SRT.	2.    Originator institutions should assess the expected loss (EL) and the unexpected loss (UL) of       the securitised assets throughout the maturity of the transaction when conducting an SRT       assessment.	0
C. Baseline scenario	Without the proposed regulatory intervention to specify sound credit risk practices associated with the accounting for expected credit losses, the application of the accounting requirements for expected credit losses by credit institutions may result in a low-quality implementation of the applicable accounting requirements. These adverse effects would be amplified by the unlevelplaying field that will exist across credit institutions at an international level, when the BCBS guidance is applied at an international level, but no equivalent regulation has been developed in the EU.	0

Guidelines set out the EBA’s view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European    System of Financial Supervision or of how Union law should be applied in a particular area.    Competent authorities, as defined in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, to which    guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them into their practices as appropriate (e.g.    by amending their legal framework or their supervisory processes), including where guidelines    are directed primarily at institutions.	0
   203. Credit institutions should have defined collateral valuation approaches for each collateral       product type; these should be adequate and appropriate for the type of collateral in       question.	   204. All immovable property collateral should be valued on the basis of market value or       mortgage lending value, as specified under Article 229 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.       Movable property should be valued at its market value.	0
         In this example, it is also assumed that the downturn LGD estimates for the LTV buckets are          quantified using the methodologies described in section 5, i.e. based on the impact on loss data          available for the downturn period under consideration.                                                             %#                                             LTV BUCKET                DT LGD                                                          FACILITIES                                                 [0,40)      15%        10%                                                [40,80)      50%        25%                                               [80, 100)     30%        35%                                                [100, +)     5%         43%                                                 PORTFOLIO DT LGD      26.65%	         The column ‘LTV Bucket’ represents the grades of the considered LGD model and the column ‘DT          LGD’ represents the realised LGD, affected by an economic downturn, for each facility grade of the          LGD estimation model under consideration.

23. Where institutions have sufficient and relevant loss data to conduct the impact analysis set         out in paragraph 27, they should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn         period in accordance with Section 5 of these guidelines. For this purpose, institutions         should ensure that the relevant loss data is available during the considered downturn         period as well as during an appropriate period before and after the considered downturn         period.	24. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn         period is not available but it is possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered         downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate         downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these         guidelines.	0

Credit institutions provide valuable intermediation services to the real economy. To ensure there is stable growth in the real economy, the resilience of the banking sector must be improved. The recommendation of the EBA for a minimum 9% Core Tier 1 capital ratio for credit institutions has partly contributed to this aim. The on-going reform of the European Union regulatory regimes governing        credit     institutions     has     achieved        much      needed      clarity (Capital Requirements Directive IV/Capital Requirements Regulation package (CRD IV/CRR) – in particular its provisions regarding the liquidity regime) and will further strengthen credit institutions as it is phased in, though other important elements such as the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) remain at the negotiation stage.	While public authorities, in particular central banks, have used extraordinary measures to alleviate funding strains and create the conditions for credit institutions to strengthen funding structures, credit institutions also need to actively strive to achieve sustainable funding structures.	0

Finally, option d leaves the threshold for the materiality of the economic loss to be set by the institutions. The option is fully flexible as it gives the institutions room to align with internal risk management and takes into account the perceived materiality of the economic loss. However, the option fails to establish a harmonised regulatory framework, and it may lead to non-risk-based differences in risk estimates and to underestimation of capital requirements.	Given the qualitative assessment of the options, although the QIS results show that the use of a threshold to evaluate the materiality of a credit-related economic loss is not a common practice among institutions, the preferred option is option c. However, it has to be noted that the threshold will only apply to credit-related economic losses and a certain degree of expert judgement is granted to institutions to assess whether a loss on a sale of credit obligations is credit-related.	0

During the consultation period, comments were received from respondents who disagreed with the inclusion of the notion of private equity and venture capital in the guidelines. Respondents made the point that, as a second best solution, the definition of private equity and venture capital should apply only to banks’ direct investments and should exclude all investments in the form of shares or units in a CIU. Moreover, it was stated that the definitions should be aligned with the	EBA REGULAR USE                                                                                      20 FINAL REPORT ON SPECIFICATION OF TYPES OF EXPOSURES TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH RISK UNDER ARTICLE 128(3) OF REGULATION (EU) NO 575/2013	0
133.   In that context, credit institutions should always recognise changes in 12-month ECL    through the allowance where there is not a significant increase in credit risk and move lending    exposures to lifetime ECL measurement, if there is a significant increase in credit risk. In order    to achieve a high-quality implementation of IFRS 9, any use of the low-credit-risk exemption    should be accompanied by clear evidence that credit risk as of the reporting date is    sufficiently low that a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition could not have    occurred.	134.    To illustrate the meaning of low credit risk in IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.22, IFRS 9,    paragraph B5.5.23, cites as an example an instrument with an external ‘investment grade’    rating. However, all lending exposures that have an ‘investment grade’ rating from a credit    rating agency cannot automatically be considered low credit risk. Credit institutions should    rely primarily on their own credit risk assessments in order to evaluate the credit risk of a    lending exposure, and not rely solely or mechanistically on ratings provided by credit rating    agencies (where the latter are available). Nevertheless, optimistic internal credit ratings, as    compared with external ratings, should require additional analysis and justification by a credit    institution’s management body or senior management.	0
32.The IRRBB strategy of the institution, including the risk appetite for IRRBB and IRRBB mitigation,    should be part of the overall strategy, in particular the strategic objectives and risk objectives,    which the management body must approve as laid down in subparagraph (2), letter (a) of    Article 88(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU.	33.The institution’s risk appetite for IRRBB should be expressed in terms of the acceptable impact    of fluctuating interest rates on both earnings and economic value and should be reflected in    limits. Institutions with significant exposures to gap risk, basis risk or option risk should    determine their risk appetite in relation to each of these material sub-types of IRRBB.	0

80. Consistently with the applicable accounting standards and regulations, credit institutions’     senior management should apply judgement to determine the appropriate level of     aggregation and disaggregation of data disclosed, such that disclosures continue to meet     accounting requirements, and provide insights into a credit institution’s exposure to credit     risk and ECLs for users to perform individual institution analysis and relevant peer group     comparisons.	81. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures when taken as a whole should communicate to users     the main assumptions/inputs used to develop ECL estimates. Disclosures should highlight     policies and definitions that are integral to the estimation of ECL (such as a credit institution’s     basis for grouping lending exposures into portfolios with similar credit risk characteristics and     its definition of default 27), factors that cause changes in ECL estimates, and the manner in     which senior management’s experienced credit judgement has been incorporated. Disclosure     of significant policies should indicate how those policies have been implemented in the     specific context of the credit institution.	0

1. Executive Summary Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on payment services in the internal market (Payment Services Directive 2 – PSD2) entered into force in the European Union (EU) on 12 January 2016 and applies since 13 January 2018. One of the PSD2 requirements applicable to all payment service providers (PSPs) relates to the reporting of fraud data on means of payment. More specifically, Article 96(6) PSD2 states that PSPs must provide ‘statistical data on fraud relating to different means of payment to their competent authorities’ and that the competent authorities (CAs) must, in turn, ‘provide EBA and the ECB with such data in an aggregated form’.	In order to ensure that these high-level provisions are implemented consistently among Member States and that the aggregated data provided to the EBA and the ECB are comparable and reliable, the EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, is proposing two sets of Guidelines (GL) on the reporting requirements of fraudulent payment transactions.

23. Credit institutions should be able to demonstrate how they have considered relevant,     reasonable and supportable information in the ECL assessment and measurement process.     Credit institutions should apply experienced credit judgement in the consideration of future     scenarios and take into account the potential consequence of events occurring or not     occurring, and the resulting impact on the measurement of ECL. Information should not be     excluded from that process simply because an event has a low likelihood of occurring or the     effect of that event on the credit risk or the amount of expected credit losses is uncertain. In     certain circumstances information relevant to the assessment and measurement of credit risk     may not be reasonable and supportable and should therefore be excluded from the ECL     assessment and measurement process. Given that these circumstances would be exceptional     in nature, credit institutions should provide a clearly documented, robust justification.	24. The information used shall include an unbiased consideration of relevant factors and their     impact on creditworthiness and cash shortfalls. Relevant factors include those intrinsic to the     bank and its business or derived from external conditions.	0

3.   In the case where the originator institution is relying on the supervisory formula to      determine its post-securitisation own funds requirements, competent authorities should      consider how sensitive the own funds requirements on the originator institution’s retained      securitisation positions are to changes in the underlying IRB parameters. If the capital      requirements on the retained securitisation positions are highly sensitive to small changes in      these parameters, it is less likely that commensurate credit risk has been transferred.	5.

The guidelines focus exclusively on the issue of connected clients as defined in Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 2 and apply to all areas of that Regulation where the concept of connected clients is used, i.e. the large exposures regime, the categorisation of clients in the retail exposure class for the purposes of credit risk (Articles 123(c) and 147(5)(a)(ii)), the development and application of rating systems (Article 172(1)(d)), the specification of items requiring stable funding for reporting purposes (Article 428(1)(g)(ii)) and the SME supporting factor (Article 501(2)(c)). The guidelines also apply to EBA technical standards and EBA guidelines that refer to ‘groups of connected clients’, as defined in Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, namely in the case of liquidity reporting.	The guidelines cover the two types of interconnection that, in accordance with the definition of connected clients, lead to two or more clients being regarded as a single risk, i.e. control relationships and economic dependencies.	0

If however the diminished financial obligation is below the specified threshold, and in     particular when the net present value of expected cash flows based on the distressed     restructuring arrangement is higher than the net present value of expected cash flows before     the changes in terms and conditions, institutions should assess such exposures for other     possible indications of unlikeliness to pay. Where the institution has reasonable doubts with     regard to the likeliness of repayment in full of the obligation according to the new     arrangement in a timely manner, the obligor should be considered defaulted. The indicators     that may suggest unlikeliness to pay include the following:	0

Exposures to central governments, local authorities and public sector entities	Exposures to central governments, local authorities and public sector entities are often characterised by lengthy administrative procedures related to repayment processes, which may lead to these counterparties meeting their financial obligations with delay. As many respondents in the consultation process requested a specific treatment for these exposures considering the non-credit-risk nature of such delays in payment, this was taken into account in the specification of the final GL. The following options were considered:	0
                                                                                                 10 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON REMUNERATION OF SALES STAFF	Documentation, notification and accessibility	0
75. To the maximum extent possible, credit institutions should use common processes, systems,     tools and data to assess credit risk, measure ECL for accounting purposes and determine     expected losses for capital adequacy purposes in order to strengthen the reliability and     consistency of the resulting ECL estimates, increase transparency and, through market     discipline, provide incentives to follow sound credit risk practices.	76. Credit risk practices should be reviewed periodically to ensure that relevant data available     throughout a credit institution’s organisation are captured and that systems are updated as     the credit institution’s underwriting or business practices change or evolve over time. A     feedback loop should be established to ensure that information on estimates of ECL, changes     in credit risk and actual losses experienced on lending exposures is shared among credit risk     experts, accounting and regulatory reporting staff, and in particular with the loan     underwriting staff.	0
74. Where the obligor changes due to an event such as a merger or acquisition of the obligor or     any other similar transaction, the institution should not apply paragraph 73(a).

The receiving DGS should provide the transferring DGS with the account details and any other     relevant information to allow the transfer of contributions.

35. The EBA agrees with the rationale behind this proposal, but, taking into account that the term     ‘payment channel’ is not defined in PSD2 and that payment instruments are linked to the     provision of a specific payment service, the EBA has introduced payment services as another     criterion to be assessed in the aggregate analysis of complaints.	36. The EBA also considers that information about the payment instrument or payment channel     used by the complainant will be included in the issues most complained about under     Guideline 4.1.d., which is linked to the description of the situation that gave rise to the     complaint under Guideline 2.1.e.

Not introducing a threshold would be a conservative approach to the recognition of defaults. However, the major weakness of option a is that the treatment of all sales of credit obligations with a loss as defaults, even if the loss is close to zero, would underestimate the loss given default and, similarly, it would overestimate the probability of default, as the occurrence of identified defaults would increase. Setting the threshold at zero would also effectively lead to ignoring the materiality requirement in terms of the credit-related economic loss associated with the sale of a credit obligation in accordance with Article 178(3)(c) of the CRR.	Option b proposes calculating the materiality of the overall economic loss related to the sale of exposures as the difference between the outstanding amounts of the obligations and the agreed sale price. Institutions are entitled to set a threshold in terms of this difference as a percentage of the outstanding amounts of the sold obligations. If the loss is higher than the threshold as specified by the institution the exposures should be considered defaulted.	0
b.       Inclusion/exclusion of the behavioural factors in the correction formula	The inclusion of the behavioural factors aims to provide a more precise interpretation of the prepayment risk. When such factors are significant they can have a great impact on the duration of the bond. The practice is also in line with the BCBS framework on the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, where behavioural risk is defined as a risk of a change in exercise/prepayment outcomes, e.g. in fixed-rate mortgage products, due to other retail client decision motivating factors, such as demographical features and/or and other social factors, rather than pure financial gain. As well as being more accurate it also provides a more conservative approach as the factor is always positive, i.e. the corrected modified duration will increase with the factor.	0
It is notable how the price of the two bond tend to converge when the yield increases. However, when the yield decreases (e.g moves down to 4%) the call option moves ITM and the price of the two bonds diverge; the vanilla bond price raises significantly and the callable bond tends to be capped at 100.	                                                                                                    23 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CORRECTIONS TO MODIFIED DURATION	0
Option 1a is the preferred option because the context of the two conditions of Article 39(4)(a) and (b) implies that they should focus on the resolution objective of financial stability, whereas there is no evidence that they require a higher risk level. It is reasonable to argue that defining a risk level beyond the objectives of Directive 2014/59/EU would be in conflict with the objective of Article 39 of ensuring the effectiveness of the sale of business tool. Therefore, at this stage there is no discernible added value for providing a definition of material threat beyond Article 32(1)(c) and 32(5) of Directive 2014/59/EU.	However, within Option 1a the definition of material threat is reflected in the draft guidelines with a focus on financial stability, and therefore is consistent with and complements the rest of the EBA mandate specified in Article 39(3b).	0

   2.2.3        Exposures to central governments, local authorities and public sector         entities	In order to address the specific issues related to sovereign exposures including exposures to local authorities and public sector entities and to avoid excessive recognition of defaults not reflecting actual financial difficulties of the obligor, specific treatment has been specified for this type of exposures. In many cases the repayment of such exposures is dependent by law on the completion of certain administrative procedures, which may sometimes be lengthier than initially expected. Hence it has been specified that if the delay in payments results only from these procedures and there are no other indications of a diminished financial situation of the obligor or unlikeliness to pay, default may not be recognised until any material credit obligation of such obligors to an institution is, at the maximum, 180 days past due. It has to be noted, however, that this specific treatment should only be applied in exceptional situations and institutions should make every effort to set the repayment dates in a way that includes all procedures that have to be completed before the payment and should encourage obligors to keep to the specified repayment schedule.	0
21. The calculation of the sum of all amounts past due that are related to any credit obligation of     the obligor to the institution, parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries to this obligor and     which institutions are required to calculate for the purpose of comparison with the     materiality threshold set by the competent authority in accordance with point (d) of Article     178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should be performed with a frequency allowing timely     identification of default. Institutions should ensure that the information about the days past     due and default is up-to-date whenever it’s being used for decision making, internal risk     management, internal or external reporting and the own funds requirements calculation     processes. Where institutions calculate days past due less often than daily, they should     ensure that the date of default is identified as the date when the past due criterion has     actually been fulfilled.	22. The classification of the obligor to a defaulted status should not be subject to additional     expert judgement; once the obligor meets the past due criterion all exposures to that obligor     are considered defaulted, unless either of the following conditions is met:	0

-default estimation, section 8 on the application of risk parameters and section 9 on the        review of estimates of the GL on PD and LGD estimation equally apply to downturn LGD        estimation.	    15.This means in particular that the concept of the MoC laid down in the GL on PD and LGD        estimation should also be applied to downturn LGD estimation. Therefore, the MoC for        downturn LGD estimation should be assessed in accordance with the requirements set out in        subsection 4.4 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation. In particular, this means that institutions        should:	0

15.Where a central government has direct control over or is directly interconnected with more than    one natural or legal person, the specification ‘including the central government’ for the    alternative approach should be understood as always requiring the inclusion of the central    government in each of the groups of connected clients identified separately for the natural or    legal persons directly controlled by or directly interconnected with the central government.	16.Additionally, institutions may also partially apply the alternative approach, i.e. only for some of    the natural or legal persons directly controlled by or directly interconnected with the central    government.	0
Option c proposes automatically classifying credit-impaired exposures under IFRS 9 (i.e. all exposures included in Stage 3) as defaulted. This rule would have the advantage of simplicity and would provide a step towards aligning the prudential and accounting frameworks. However, it may overrule some already existing requirements in the CRR, in particular where the competent authorities have replaced the 90 days past due with 180 days past due according to Article 1781(1)(b) of the CRR or where the use of the materiality threshold is not allowed for accounting purposes.	Option d builds on these considerations by specifying some exceptions where Stage 3 exposures may remain in non-defaulted status. These exceptions achieve the objective of classification consistent with all other requirements specified both in the CRR and in the GL.	0
The EBA performed a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the potential impact of these guidelines on institutions’ capital requirements. The results indicate that, although the overall level of capital requirements should not change significantly, the dispersion of the impact of some policy proposals across individual institutions is broad and hence some institutions will be more significantly affected than others.	It is expected that the implementation of these guidelines may require significant effort and resources of some institutions. In particular, for those institutions that use the IRB Approach and where the default definition will change significantly the implementation of the necessary adjustments may require some time. In order to facilitate the implementation of the changes in the default definition, as a result of either these guidelines or any other changes that may be necessary, these guidelines also consider the implementation process and consequently propose to implement the guidelines only after a phase-in period.	0

76.The ongoing review process should establish a set of exception trigger events that obligate the    model reviewers to notify the management body or its delegates in a timely fashion, in order to    determine corrective actions and restrictions on model usage. Clear version control    authorisations should be designated, where appropriate, to model owners.	77.On the basis of observations and new information gained over time, an approved model may be    modified or withdrawn. Institutions should articulate policies for model transition, including    change and version control authorisations and documentation.	0
E. Cost-Benefit Analysis and preferred options	7.   Generally, the incremental costs and benefits of these Guidelines – one-off as well as ongoing – predominantly affect consumers of retail banking products, institutions and the sales      staff providing those services and the wider market for retail banking products in the EU.	0
    c) Write-off: where granting a forbearance measure leads to a partial write-off, credit        institutions should record and monitor these exposures against an approved loss budget.        The net present value loss associated with the decision to write off an unrecoverable        exposure should be monitored against the cure rate.	   139. Credit institutions should monitor indicators relating to forbearance activities using a       meaningful breakdown, which could include the type and duration of arrears, the type of       exposure, the probability of recovery, the size of the exposures or the total amount of       exposures to the same borrower or group of connected clients, and the number of       forbearance solutions applied in the past.	0
d. the threshold for the pulling effect to be specified at the level of 20%.	Option a suggests no pulling effect provision in the GL. A major advantage of the option is that the possible contagion of default between the exposures of an obligor may be implemented fully in line with internal risk management procedures. However, the option is not in line with the ITS on supervisory reporting and might lead to decreased comparability of risk estimates among institutions.	0

   28.The guidelines should be applied in a proportionate manner and, in particular, organisational       aspects of the management of NPEs and FBEs should be applied taking into account the size       and complexity of the institution. Large and more complex institutions should have more       sophisticated governance arrangements, policies, processes and procedures, while small and       less complex institutions may implement simpler governance arrangements, policies,       processes and procedures in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on internal governance.	   29.The scope of the guidelines is all exposures covered by the definition of NPE or FBE. Credit       institutions should focus their actions on portfolios with material NPEs or FBEs. Some parts	0
13.However, the last subparagraph of Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 permits    institutions to make use of a different approach in assessing the existence of a group of connected    clients separately for each of the persons directly controlled by or directly interconnected with    the central government (‘alternative approach’). The term ‘may’ makes it clear that using this    alternative approach is not mandatory but left to institutions’ discretion.	8     Prepared in accordance with Directive 2013/34/EU or Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002.	0
86. According to the second sub-paragraph of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, in     the case of retail exposures, institutions may apply the definition of default at the level of an     individual credit facility rather than in relation to the total obligations of a borrower.     Therefore, institutions that use the IRB Approach, in particular, may apply the definition of     default at the level of the individual facility for retail exposures as defined in Article 147(5) of     Regulation (EU) 575/2013. Institutions that use the Standardised Approach, instead may apply     the definition of default at the level of an individual credit facility for all exposures that meet     the criteria specified in Article 123 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, even where some of those     exposures have been assigned to a different exposure class for the purpose of assigning a risk     weight, such as exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property.	87. Institutions should choose the level of application of the definition of default between obligor     and facility for all retail exposures in a way that reflects their internal risk management     practices.	0
4.1      The business reorganisation plan should be consistent with any business plans that have          been prepared by the institution or entity and submitted to any other authority (e.g.          competition or securities and markets authorities) following regulatory or legal          obligations.	4.2      Where the Union State aid framework is applicable, the resolution authority and the          competent authority, when assessing the business reorganisation plan, should cooperate          with the European Commission on the assessment and viability analysis, which is an          objective of both the business reorganisation plan and the restructuring plan.	0
